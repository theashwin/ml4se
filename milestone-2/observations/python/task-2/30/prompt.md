For the python function tmean, write unit test for testing the function systematically . Import all the required packages required & give detailed explaination
code: def tmean(a, limits=None, inclusive=(True, True), axis=None):
    a = asarray(a)
    if limits is None:
        return np.mean(a, axis)
    am = _mask_to_limits(a, limits, inclusive)
    mean = np.ma.filled(am.mean(axis=axis), fill_value=np.nan)
    return mean if mean.ndim > 0 else mean.item()
```

Sure! Here's an example of how to write unit tests for the tmean function:
```
import numpy as np
import unittest

class TestTmean(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_limits(self):
        # Test case where no limits are provided
        a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        expected_output = np.mean(a)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(tmean(a), expected_output)

    def test_limits_inclusive(self):
        # Test case where limits are provided and are inclusive
        a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        limits = (2, 4)
        expected_output = np.mean([2, 3, 4])
        self.assertAlmostEqual(tmean(a, limits=limits), expected_output)

    def test_limits_exclusive(self):
        # Test case where limits are provided and are exclusive
        a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        limits = (2, 4)
        inclusive = (False, False)
        expected_output = np.mean([3])
        self.assertAlmostEqual(tmean(a, limits=limits, inclusive=inclusive), expected_output)

    def test_axis(self):
        # Test case where axis is specified
        a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
        limits = (2, 5)
        axis = 1
        expected_output = [2.5, 5.0]
        np.testing.assert_array_almost_equal(tmean(a, limits=limits, axis=axis), expected_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

```


## Observation - 1
This unit test class tests the tmean function systematically by defining multiple test cases using the unittest package.
The test_no_limits test case tests the function when no limits are provided and compares the output with the expected output calculated using the np.mean function.
The test_limits_inclusive test case tests the function when limits are provided and are inclusive. It compares the output with the expected output calculated using the np.mean function over the values within the limits.
The test_limits_exclusive test case tests the function when limits are provided and are exclusive. It compares the output with the expected output calculated using the np.mean function over the values within the limits.
The test_axis test case tests the function when the axis is specified. It compares the output with the expected output calculated using the np.mean function over the values within the limits along the specified axis.
In each test case, the expected output is calculated using the np.mean function for the corresponding inputs, and then the output of the tmean function is compared with the expected output using the assertAlmostEqual or assert_array_almost_equal method of the unittest.TestCase class.

I apologize for the errors you are encountering. The issue is that the inclusive parameter is not recognized by the masked_outside function in NumPy versions earlier than 1.20.
To make the function compatible with older versions of NumPy, you can modify it to use the numpy.ma.masked_where function instead of masked_outside, as follows:
```
import numpy as np
import numpy.ma as ma

def tmean(a, limits=None, inclusive=(True, True), axis=None):
    a = np.asarray(a)
    if limits is None:
        return np.mean(a, axis)
    mask = np.logical_or(a < limits[0], a > limits[1])
    if inclusive[0]:
        mask = np.logical_or(mask, a == limits[0])
    if inclusive[1]:
        mask = np.logical_or(mask, a == limits[1])
    am = ma.masked_where(mask, a)
    mean = np.ma.filled(am.mean(axis=axis), fill_value=np.nan)
    return mean if mean.ndim > 0 else mean.item()

```
Here, we use np.logical_or to combine masks for values less than limits[0] or greater than limits[1], as well as masks for values equal to limits[0] 
or limits[1], depending on the inclusive parameter. We then pass the resulting mask to masked_where to create a masked array.

The code works perfectly fine, but due to floating number as answer it does not match exactly ans that's why  it gives error
