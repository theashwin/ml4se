For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent function. 
Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Method signature should remain identical, Return type of the function 
should also remain identical, Add comments to the method when required, Add <python/docstring> to the method.
code: def _norm(x0, x1):
    m = max(abs(x0), abs(x1))
    with errstate(invalid="ignore"):
        a = (x0 / m) * (x0 / m)
        b = (x1 / m) * (x1 / m)
        return nan_to_num(m * sqrt(a + b))

## Observation - 2
```
The function takes in two float arguments representing the components of a two-dimensional vector and returns a float representing the norm of that vector. The function raises a ZeroDivisionError if both components of the vector are zero.
The function first calculates the maximum absolute value of the two components using the max() and abs() functions. It then uses a context manager from numpy.errstate to ignore any invalid calculations that may arise when one of the components is zero.
The normalized squares of each component are then calculated by dividing each component by the maximum absolute value, squaring the result, and storing it in variables norm_sq_x0 and norm_sq_x1.
Finally, the function calculates the square root of the sum of the normalized component squares, multiplies it by the maximum absolute value, and returns the result. The nan_to_num() function is used to convert any NaN values to 0.0.
