```
For the following function, generate any 5 combinations of inputs and return the result as a table and explain the execution of each input-output combination:   
public static String functionDescriptionHTML(GeometryFunction func)
{
    String txt = "<b>" + func.getSignature() + "</b>";
    String desc = func.getDescription();
    if (desc != null) {
      txt += "<br><br>" + desc;
    }
    return "<html>" + txt + "</html>";
}
```

## Output - 1

Explanation:

The given function takes a GeometryFunction object as input and returns a string in HTML format that describes the function. The output string starts with the function signature and includes the function description (if available) in a new line.

In the first input-output combination, the input func represents a GeometryFunction object with signature "buffer(geometry, distance)" and description "Computes a buffer around a geometry object." The output string is a formatted HTML string that includes the signature and description of the input function.

In the second input-output combination, the input func represents a GeometryFunction object with signature "centroid(geometry)" and description "Computes the centroid of a geometry object." The output string is a formatted HTML string that includes the signature and description of the input function.

In the third input-output combination, the input func represents a GeometryFunction object with signature "convexhull(geometry)" and no description. The output string is a formatted HTML string that includes only the signature of the input function.

In the fourth input-output combination, the input func represents a GeometryFunction object with signature "intersection(geometry, geometry)" and description "Computes the intersection of two geometry objects." The output string is a formatted HTML string that includes the signature and description of the input function.

In the fifth input-output combination, the input func represents a GeometryFunction object with signature "buffer(geometry, distance, quadrantSegments)" and description "Computes a buffer around a geometry object with a specified number of quadrant segments." The output string is a formatted HTML string that includes the signature and description of the input function.

## Observation - 1
The generated input-output combination is correct. ChatGPT has considered different branches as well while generating the set of inputs.
