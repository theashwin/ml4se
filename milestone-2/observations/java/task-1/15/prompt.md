## Prompt - 1
```
For the following function, generate any 5 combinations of inputs and return the result as a table and explain the execution of each input-output combination: 
private void invokeEachA(Geometry geom, Object[] args, List<Geometry> result) {
    int nElt = geom.getNumGeometries();
    for (int i = 0; i < nElt; i++) {
      Geometry geomN = geom.getGeometryN(i);
      invokeB(geomN, args, result);
    }
}
```

Sure, here are five combinations of inpu ts and their corresponding outputs:
<br/>
![img.png](table-1.png)
This function takes a Geometry object and an array of arguments, and recursively calls the invokeB method on each sub-geometry of the input Geometry. The invokeB method populates the result list with the results of each call.

For example, if the input Geometry is a Point object and the args array contains two elements, the invokeEachA method will simply call the invokeB method with the input Point object and the args array, and then add the result (which is always null in this case) to the result list.

If the input Geometry is a GeometryCollection object, which contains multiple sub-geometries, the invokeEachA method will recursively call itself on each sub-geometry, effectively traversing the entire geometry tree. The result list will then contain the results of all the invokeB calls for each sub-geometry.

## Observation - 1
1. If function is not returning anything, ChatGPT generates all output as null. We may have to update prompt such that for function with void return type, ChatGPT will give info of other elements getting impacted for different inputs.
2. ChatGPT doesn't consider the input's different combination if it is not causing any branching in the code flow. (Here it was)

## Prompt - 2
```
For the following function, generate any 5 combinations of inputs, return the result as a table and explain the execution of each input-output combination. 
Explain the behaviour of function for each input combination: 
private void invokeEachA(Geometry geom, Object[] args, List<Geometry> result) {
    int nElt = geom.getNumGeometries();
    for (int i = 0; i < nElt; i++) {
      Geometry geomN = geom.getGeometryN(i);
      invokeB(geomN, args, result);
    }
}
```

## Output - 2
The function invokeEachA takes a Geometry object, an array of Object arguments, and a List of Geometry objects as inputs. It iterates over all the geometries contained in the input Geometry object and calls the invokeB function on each of them with the same input arguments and output List. The output is not returned explicitly, but is added to the result list.

Here are five example input-output combinations:

## Observation - 2
Asking ChatGPT to explain about behaviour of function though it is not returning anything, gives us idea about execution of function for different types of inputs.

## Prompt - 3
```
For the Java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write 
three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function.
Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. 
The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.
code: private void invokeEachA(Geometry geom, Object[] args, List<Geometry> result) {
    int nElt = geom.getNumGeometries();
    for (int i = 0; i < nElt; i++) {
      Geometry geomN = geom.getGeometryN(i);
      invokeB(geomN, args, result);
    }
}
```

## Output - 3
Inputs:

geom: a Polygon geometry with 3 exterior rings and 2 interior rings
args: an Object array with a single String object "test"
result: an empty List of Geometry objects
Outputs:
<br/>
![img.png](table-3.png)

1. When the input polygon geometry has no interior rings, the function will not enter the for loop and return an empty list.

2. When the input polygon geometry has interior rings, the for loop will iterate over each subgeometry and call the function invokeB with the subgeometry, args and result. In this example, the function will be called for each exterior ring and each interior ring, resulting in a list with 5 Geometry objects.

3. When the input polygon geometry has no interior rings and the args array is empty, the function will not enter the for loop and return an empty list.

## Observation - 3
Modifying prompt so that ChatGPT will give explanation of function's behaviour irrespective of its return type.

## Prompt - 4
```
Show calculations and reason for each of the three input-output pairs.
```

## Output - 4
1. Input: geom = a Geometry object containing 3 Point objects, args = an empty Object array, result = an empty List<Geometry>
Output: No output
Reasoning: The getNumGeometries() method of geom returns 3, so the loop runs 3 times. In each iteration, the getGeometryN() method returns one of the Point objects in geom, and invokeB() is called with this Point object, an empty Object array, and an empty List<Geometry>. Since invokeB() has no side effects, the function does not produce any output.

2. Input: geom = a LineString object containing 4 Coordinate objects, args = an empty Object array, result = an empty List<Geometry>
Output: The result list contains 4 Point objects.
Reasoning: The getNumGeometries() method of geom returns 1, so the loop runs once. In each iteration, the getGeometryN() method returns the LineString object itself. The invokeB() method calls the getCoordinates() method of the LineString object, which returns an array of Coordinate objects. The loop iterates over the Coordinate objects and creates a Point object for each one. The Point objects are added to the result list.

3. Input: geom = a GeometryCollection object containing a Polygon and a LineString, args = an empty Object array, result = an empty List<Geometry>
Output: The result list contains 5 Point objects.
Reasoning: The getNumGeometries() method of geom returns 2, so the loop runs twice. In the first iteration, the getGeometryN() method returns the Polygon object. The invokeB() method calls the getCoordinates() method of the Polygon object, which returns an array of Coordinate objects. The loop iterates over the Coordinate objects and creates a Point object for each one. The Point objects are added to the result list. In the second iteration, the getGeometryN() method returns the LineString object. The invokeB() method calls the getCoordinates() method of the LineString object, which returns an array of Coordinate objects. The loop iterates over the Coordinate objects and creates a Point object for each one. The Point objects are added to the result list.
