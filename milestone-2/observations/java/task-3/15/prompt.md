```
Can you generate semantically equivalent code for the method below?
code: private void invokeEachA(Geometry geom, Object[] args, List<Geometry> result) {
        int nElt = geom.getNumGeometries();
        for (int i = 0; i < nElt; i++) {
            Geometry geomN = geom.getGeometryN(i);
            invokeB(geomN, args, result);
        }
    }
```

## Output - 1
Sure! Here's the equivalent code:

```
private void invokeEachA(Geometry geom, Object[] args, List<Geometry> result) {
    for (Geometry geomN : geom) {
        invokeB(geomN, args, result);
    }
}
```
Explanation:

The for loop in the original method iterates over each geometry within the input geom object.
In the semantically equivalent code, the enhanced for loop (also known as "for-each" loop) is used to iterate over each geometry within geom.
The getGeometryN method is not used in the semantically equivalent code because the Geometry class implements the Iterable interface, allowing it to be used in an enhanced for loop.

## Observation - 1
- ChatGPT fails to provide the correct output as `geom` is an object of the `Geometry` class and not a collection so iterating over it will not work.

## Prompt - 2
Given that you have no context of `geom` object, you don't know if `geom` is an array or a collection, how can you generate a code that iterates over it?

## Output - 2
If the type of geom is unknown, we can use the instanceof operator to check if it is an instance of a collection or an array. If geom is an array, we can iterate over it using a for loop. If it is a collection, we can use a for-each loop to iterate over its elements. Here is a possible implementation:
```
private void invokeEachA(Geometry geom, Object[] args, List<Geometry> result) {
    if (geom instanceof Collection) {
        Collection<Geometry> geomCollection = (Collection<Geometry>) geom;
        for (Geometry geomN : geomCollection) {
            invokeB(geomN, args, result);
        }
    } else if (geom instanceof Geometry[]) {
        Geometry[] geomArray = (Geometry[]) geom;
        for (int i = 0; i < geomArray.length; i++) {
            Geometry geomN = geomArray[i];
            invokeB(geomN, args, result);
        }
    } else {
        // handle the case where geom is not a collection or an array
    }
}
```

## Observation - 2
- ChatGPT is still not able to understand the question, and it tries to generate code which only iterates over `geom`.
- It tries to check if it is an instance of collection or array and generates code to handle it.
- But for the else part it is unable to generate any code.
