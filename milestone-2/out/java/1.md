# Method under consideration:

**func_id** : 1 <br/> 
 **repository** : https://github.com/Esri/geometry-api-java <br/> 
**location** : src/main/java/com/esri/core/geometry/Bufferer.java <br/> 
**flag** : hard <br/> 
**function** : <br/>

private void progress_() {
		m_progress_counter++;
		if (m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0) {
			if ((m_progress_tracker != null)
					&& !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)))
				throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
		}
	} 
``` 


# Reasoning

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three combination of m_progress_counter and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.

code: 

```

private void progress_() {
		m_progress_counter++;
		if (m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0) {
			if ((m_progress_tracker != null)
					&& !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)))
				throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
		}
	}

```

The given code increments a counter variable called 'm_progress_counter' and checks if it is divisible by 1024. If it is, and if a progress tracker object exists (m_progress_tracker is not null) and its 'progress' method returns false, then a "user_canceled" RuntimeException is thrown. 

Table:
 
| m_progress_counter | Progress Tracker | Output              |
|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 256                | not null          | --                    |
| 1024               | null              | --                    |
| 1024               | not null          | RuntimeException      |
| 2048               | not null          | --                    |
| 3072               | not null          | RuntimeException      |
| 4096               | null              | --                    |
| 4096               | not null          | RuntimeException      |

Explanation:

1. When m_progress_counter is 256 and the progress tracker exists, the code does not throw an exception. 
2. When m_progress_counter is 1024 and there's no progress tracker, the code does not throw an exception.
3. When m_progress_counter is 1024 and there is a progress tracker, the 'progress' method of the tracker is called with -1,-1 as arguments. If this method returns false, a RuntimeException is thrown with message "user_canceled". Otherwise, the code continues without throwing any exceptions.
4. When m_progress_counter is 2048, the code does not throw an exception because 2048 is not divisible by 1024.
5. When m_progress_counter is 3072 and there is a progress tracker, the 'progress' method of the tracker is called again with -1,-1 as arguments. If this method returns false, a RuntimeException is thrown with message "user_canceled". Otherwise, the code continues without throwing any exceptions.
6. When m_progress_counter is 4096 and there is no progress tracker, the code does not throw an exception.
7. When m_progress_counter is 4096 and there is a progress tracker, the 'progress' method of the tracker is called. If this method returns false, a RuntimeException is thrown with message "user_canceled". Otherwise, the code continues without throwing any exceptions.

Therefore, depending on the value of m_progress_counter and the status of the progress tracker, the code may throw an exception. Otherwise, it simply increments the counter and proceeds.

Show calculations and reason for each of the three input-output pairs.

Sure, here are the calculations and reasons for each of the three input-output pairs:

1. 

|m_progress_counter| = 512
|Progress Tracker| = not null
|Output| = --

Calculation:

Since m_progress_counter is 512, it is not divisible by 1024. Therefore, the code will not execute the block of code inside the if statement. The output will be empty, indicated by "--".

Reason:

The value of m_progress_counter is less than the value required to trigger the progress tracker check. Since the progress tracker is not null, the method calls the progress method with -1,-1 as arguments, but this does not affect the output in this case.

2. 

|m_progress_counter| = 2048
|Progress Tracker| = null
|Output| = --

Calculation:

Since m_progress_counter is 2048, it is not divisible by 1024. Therefore, the code will not execute the block of code inside the if statement. The output will be empty, indicated by "--".

Reason: 

The value of m_progress_counter is greater than or equal to 1024, but it is not divisible by 1024. Since there is no progress tracker, the method doesn't make any calls to the progress method.

3. 

|m_progress_counter| = 1536
|Progress Tracker| = not null
|Output| = RuntimeException

Calculation:

Since m_progress_counter is 1536, it is not divisible by 1024. Therefore, the code will not execute the block of code inside the if statement. The output will be empty, indicated by "--". 

Reason: 

The value of m_progress_counter is greater than or equal to 1024, but it is not divisible by 1024. Since there is a progress tracker and the value of m_progress_counter is not a multiple of 1024, the method will not call the progress method so the output remains empty. So, the code does not throw any exceptions.

# Tests

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write unit test for testing the function. Import all the required packages and mock all the functions and classes required by the method.

Refactor the unit test produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

```

private void progress_() {
		m_progress_counter++;
		if (m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0) {
			if ((m_progress_tracker != null)
					&& !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)))
				throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
		}
	}

```

To refactor the unit test, we first need to create a class that holds this method, as we cannot test private methods directly. Also, we need to provide more context and information about the dependencies of this method. 

Assuming that `progress_tracker` is a third-party class with a public `progress` method that takes in two long values, and that `m_progress_counter` and `m_progress_tracker` are fields of the class containing the `progress_()` method, we can write the following unit test:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;

public class ProgressTest {

  private ProgressTracker mockProgressTracker;
  private Progress subject;

  @Before
  public void setUp() {
    mockProgressTracker = mock(ProgressTracker.class);
    subject = new Progress(mockProgressTracker);
  }

  @Test
  public void testProgressUpdatesCounter() {
    assertEquals(0, subject.getProgressCounter());
    subject.progress_();
    assertEquals(1, subject.getProgressCounter());
  }

  @Test
  public void testProgressDoesNotCallTrackerWhenCounterIsNot1024() {
    subject.progress_();
    assertEquals(1, subject.getProgressCounter());
    assertEquals(0, mockProgressTracker.progressCallsCount);
  }

  @Test
  public void testProgressCallsTrackerWhenCounterIs1024() {
    when(mockProgressTracker.progress(-1L, -1L)).thenReturn(true);
    Progress subject = new Progress(mockProgressTracker);
    for (int i = 1; i <= 1024; i++) {
      subject.progress_();
    }
    assertEquals(1024, subject.getProgressCounter());
    assertEquals(1, mockProgressTracker.progressCallsCount);
  }

  @Test(expected = RuntimeException.class)
  public void testProgressThrowsExceptionWhenTrackerReturnsFalse() {
    when(mockProgressTracker.progress(-1L, -1L)).thenReturn(false);
    Progress subject = new Progress(mockProgressTracker);
    for (int i = 1; i <= 1024; i++) {
      subject.progress_();
    }
  }
}

class ProgressTracker {

  public int progressCallsCount;

  public boolean progress(long current, long max) {
    progressCallsCount++;
    return true;
  }
}

class Progress {
  private int m_progress_counter = 0;
  private ProgressTracker m_progress_tracker;

  public Progress(ProgressTracker progressTracker) {
    m_progress_counter = 0;
    m_progress_tracker = progressTracker;
  }

  public int getProgressCounter() {
    return m_progress_counter;
  }

  public void progress_() {
    m_progress_counter++;
    if (m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0) {
      if ((m_progress_tracker != null) && !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1L, -1L))) {
        throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we use the Mockito library to mock the `ProgressTracker` class, allowing us to control its behavior and verify that it gets called correctly. We create a separate `Progress` class to hold the `progress_()` method, which takes the `ProgressTracker` dependency as a constructor argument. 

We then write four tests to cover the different scenarios in which the method can execute: it increments the counter without calling the tracker, it calls the tracker once when the counter reaches 1024, it throws an exception when the tracker returns false, and it doesn't throw an exception when the tracker returns true. 

Finally, we added a helper field `progressCallsCount` to the `ProgressTracker` class to count how many times the `progress()` method gets called, and we added a `getProgressCounter()` method in the `Progress` class to allow us to check the counter value for our tests.

# Refactoring

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent code. Keep the method signature as it is just modify the contents of the function.

Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient. 

```

private void progress_() {
		m_progress_counter++;
		if (m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0) {
			if ((m_progress_tracker != null)
					&& !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)))
				throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
		}
	}

```

A semantically equivalent and more efficient code for the given function is:

```
private void progress_() {
    m_progress_counter++;
    if (m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0 && m_progress_tracker != null && !m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)) {
        throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
    }
}
```

Here, we have combined the conditional statements using the `&&` operator which reduces the number of if statements. Additionally, we are checking if `m_progress_tracker` is not null before calling `progress()` method to avoid a NullPointerException.
