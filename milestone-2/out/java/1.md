# Reasoning

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Step by step. Be as specific as possible. Assume variable's contents as required.

| Input                   | Output             |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| m_progress_counter = 0   | m_progress_counter = 1 |
| m_progress_tracker = null | No exception, m_progress_counter = 1 |
| m_progress_counter = 1023| m_progress_counter = 1024, No exception |
| m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1) = true | No exception, m_progress_counter = 1 |

The function `progress_()` takes no input and has no output. It accesses two instance variables: `m_progress_counter` and `m_progress_tracker`. `m_progress_counter` is incremented by one each time `progress_()` is called. If `m_progress_counter` is a multiple of 1024, the function checks whether `m_progress_tracker` is not `null` and whether `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)` returns `true`. If both conditions are met, no exceptions are thrown and the function ends normally. If either condition is not met, a `RuntimeException` with the message `"user_canceled"` is thrown. 

For the first input, `m_progress_counter` is initially set to 0. When `progress_()` is called, `m_progress_counter` is incremented to 1 and no exception is thrown. 

For the second input, `m_progress_tracker` is set to `null`. When `progress_()` is called, `m_progress_counter` is incremented to 1 and no exception is thrown because the `if` block checking the progress tracker is not executed since `m_progress_tracker == null`. 

For the third input, `m_progress_counter` is initially set to 1023. When `progress_()` is called, `m_progress_counter` is incremented to 1024 but no exception is thrown because the `if` block checking the progress tracker is not executed since `m_progress_counter % 1024 != 0`. 

For the fourth input, `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)` returns `true`. When `progress_()` is called, `m_progress_counter` is incremented to 1 and no exception is thrown because the `if` block checking the progress tracker is not executed since `m_progress_counter % 1024 != 0` and `m_progress_tracker != null`.

Show calculations for each of the three input-output pairs. Step by step. 

For the first input, `m_progress_counter` is initially set to 0. When `progress_()` is called, `m_progress_counter` is incremented to 1 and no exception is thrown.

```
Initial Values:
- m_progress_counter = 0

Execution of progress_():
- m_progress_counter++; // increment counter by 1
- m_progress_counter is now 1

Final Values:
- m_progress_counter = 1
```

For the second input, `m_progress_tracker` is set to `null`. When `progress_()` is called, `m_progress_counter` is incremented to 1 and no exception is thrown because the `if` block checking the progress tracker is not executed since `m_progress_tracker == null`. 

```
Initial Values:
- m_progress_counter = 0
- m_progress_tracker = null

Execution of progress_():
- m_progress_counter++; // increment counter by 1
- m_progress_tracker == null, so if block not executed

Final Values:
- m_progress_counter = 1
- m_progress_tracker = null
```

For the third input, `m_progress_counter` is initially set to 1023. When `progress_()` is called, `m_progress_counter` is incremented to 1024 but no exception is thrown because the `if` block checking the progress tracker is not executed since `m_progress_counter % 1024 != 0`. 

```
Initial Values:
- m_progress_counter = 1023
- m_progress_tracker = someProgressTracker

Execution of progress_():
- m_progress_counter++; // increment counter by 1
- m_progress_counter % 1024 = 1023 % 1024 = 1023, so if block not executed

Final Values:
- m_progress_counter = 1024
- m_progress_tracker = someProgressTracker
```

For the fourth input, `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)` returns `true`. When `progress_()` is called, `m_progress_counter` is incremented to 1 and no exception is thrown because the `if` block checking the progress tracker is not executed since `m_progress_counter % 1024 != 0` and `m_progress_tracker != null`. 

```
Initial Values:
- m_progress_counter = 0
- m_progress_tracker = someProgressTracker

Execution of progress_():
- m_progress_counter++; // increment counter by 1
- m_progress_counter % 1024 = 1, so if block not executed

Final Values:
- m_progress_counter = 1
- m_progress_tracker = someProgressTracker
```

# Tests

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write unit test for testing the function. Import all the required packages.

Refactor the unit test produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

To write the unit test for the `progress_()` function, I will assume that the function is part of a class named `MyClass` and that the class also has a `ProgressTracker` object named `m_progress_tracker`. Here's a sample unit test code:

```
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class MyClassTest {

    @Test
    public void testProgress_() {
        MyClass myObj = new MyClass(); // create a MyClass object
        
        // create a mock object for ProgressTracker
        ProgressTracker mockProgress = new ProgressTracker() {
            @Override
            public boolean progress(int current, int total) {
                // do nothing for mock object
                return true;
            }
        };
        
        // set mockProgress as the m_progress_tracker of myObj
        myObj.m_progress_tracker = mockProgress;
        
        // call progress_() method 1023 times - progress tracker should not be called
        for (int i = 0; i < 1023; i++) {
            myObj.progress_();
            assertEquals(i+1, myObj.m_progress_counter);
        }
        
        // call progress_() method 1 more time - progress tracker should be called
        try {
            myObj.progress_();
            fail("User canceled exception not thrown");
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            assertEquals("user_canceled", e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this test, I created a mock object for `ProgressTracker` to simulate the behavior of the actual object. I set the mock object as the `m_progress_tracker` of `myObj`. 

Then, I called the `progress_()` method 1023 times, which should not trigger a call to the progress tracker. I verified that the `m_progress_counter` variable was incremented correctly in each call. 

Finally, I called the `progress_()` method one more time, which should trigger a call to the progress tracker. Since the `progress()` method of the mock object returns true, the `progress_()` method should not throw any exception. If it does, the test fails.

# Refactoring

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent code. Keep the method signature as it is just modify the contents of the function.

Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient. 

> ### Method under consideration:

>					&& !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)))
>				throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
>		}
>	} 
> ``` 


The semantically equivalent code to the given function is as follows:

```
private void progress_() {
    m_progress_counter++;
    if (m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0 && m_progress_tracker != null && !m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)) {
        throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
    }
}
```

This code increments the `m_progress_counter` variable and checks if it's a multiple of 1024. If it is, it also checks if `m_progress_tracker` is not null and if `progress(-1, -1)` returns false, indicating that the progress has been cancelled by the user. If these conditions are met, a `RuntimeException` is thrown with the message "user_canceled".
