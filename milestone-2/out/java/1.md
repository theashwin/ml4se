# Reasoning

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Step by step. Be as specific as possible. Assume variable's contents as required. 

code: 

```

private void progress_() {
		m_progress_counter++;
		if (m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0) {
			if ((m_progress_tracker != null)
					&& !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)))
				throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
		}
	}

```

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- | 
| `m_progress_counter = 1023`, `m_progress_tracker = null` |  `m_progress_counter` = 1024 | 
| `m_progress_counter = 2048`, `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1) = false` | `m_progress_counter` = 2049 and a `RuntimeException` with message "user_canceled"  is thrown |
| `m_progress_counter = 512`, `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1,-1) = true` | `m_progress_counter` = 513 |

Initially, `m_progress_counter` is initialized to some value. For the first input, assume it's `1023`. This value is incremented by 1 in the first line, so now `m_progress_counter` is `1024`. 

In the second line, a conditional statement checks if `m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0`. Since `1024` is divisible by `1024`, the condition is satisfied and the if-block is executed in this input's case. 

The if-block checks if the value of `m_progress_tracker` is null and if not, it calls `progress()` method on the object `m_progress_tracker`. The `progress()` method returns a boolean value. If the returned value is `false`(as in the 2nd input), it throws a `RuntimeException` containing the message "user_canceled". If the returned value is `true`(as in the 3rd input), the execution continues normally without any exceptions. 

Finally, in the last input, the value of `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)` is `true`. Since the condition is false, the if-block is not executed, and `m_progress_counter` is incremented to `513` in the first line. This process repeats with every call of the function.

Show calculations for each of the three input-output pairs. Step by step. 

Sure. 

**Input 1**: `m_progress_counter = 1023`, `m_progress_tracker = null`

1. `m_progress_counter` is incremented by 1: `m_progress_counter = 1024`
2. `1024 % 1024 = 0`, so the if-statement is executed
3. `m_progress_tracker` is `null`, so the if-block is skipped
4. The function completes and the output is `m_progress_counter = 1024`

**Input 2**: `m_progress_counter = 2048`, `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1) = false`

1. `m_progress_counter` is incremented by 1: `m_progress_counter = 2049`
2. `2049 % 1024 != 0`, so the if-statement is skipped
3. `m_progress_tracker` is not `null`, so `progress()` is called on it. The returned value is `false`.
4. A `RuntimeException` is thrown with the message "user_canceled"

**Input 3**: `m_progress_counter = 512`, `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1,-1) = true`

1. `m_progress_counter` is incremented by 1: `m_progress_counter = 513`
2. `513 % 1024 != 0`, so the if-statement is skipped
3. `m_progress_tracker` is not `null`, so `progress()` is called on it. The returned value is `true`.
4. The function completes and the output is `m_progress_counter = 513`

# Tests

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write unit test for testing the function. Import all the required packages.

Refactor the unit test produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

```

private void progress_() {
		m_progress_counter++;
		if (m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0) {
			if ((m_progress_tracker != null)
					&& !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)))
				throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
		}
	}

```

To write a unit test for the above function, we need to test the following scenarios:

1. Check if `m_progress_counter` is incremented by 1 after the function is called.
2. Check if the progress tracker is called every 1024 increment of `m_progress_counter`.
3. Check if the function throws a runtime exception if progress tracker returns false.

Here is the refactored unit test:

```
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;

public class TestProgress {
    
    @Test
    public void testProgressCountIncrementsByOne() {
        Progress progress = new Progress();
        int initialProgressCount = progress.getProgressCounter();
        progress.progress_();
        int newProgressCount = progress.getProgressCounter();
        assertEquals(initialProgressCount + 1, newProgressCount);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testProgressTrackerIsCalledEvery1024Increments() {
        MockProgressTracker tracker = new MockProgressTracker(true);
        Progress progress = new Progress(tracker);
        for (int i = 1; i <= 1023; i++) {
            progress.progress_();
            assertFalse(tracker.isProgressCalled());
        }
        progress.progress_();
        assertTrue(tracker.isProgressCalled());
    }
    
    @Test(expected = RuntimeException.class)
    public void testProgressThrowsRuntimeExceptionIfProgressTrackerReturnsFalse() {
        MockProgressTracker tracker = new MockProgressTracker(false);
        Progress progress = new Progress(tracker);
        progress.progress_();
    }
}

class Progress {
    private int m_progress_counter;
    private ProgressTracker m_progress_tracker;
    
    Progress() {
        m_progress_counter = 0;
        m_progress_tracker = null;
    }
    
    Progress(ProgressTracker tracker) {
        m_progress_counter = 0;
        m_progress_tracker = tracker;
    }
    
    public void progress_() {
        m_progress_counter++;
        if (m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0) {
            if ((m_progress_tracker != null) && !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1))) {
                throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
            }
        }
    }
    
    public int getProgressCounter() {
        return m_progress_counter;
    }
}

interface ProgressTracker {
    public boolean progress(int done, int total);
}

class MockProgressTracker implements ProgressTracker {
    private boolean m_isProgressCalled;
    
    MockProgressTracker(boolean isProgressCalled) {
        m_isProgressCalled = isProgressCalled;
    }
    
    public boolean progress(int done, int total) {
        m_isProgressCalled = true;
        return m_isProgressCalled;
    }
    
    public boolean isProgressCalled() {
        return m_isProgressCalled;
    }
}
```

We have created three test cases:

1. `testProgressCountIncrementsByOne()` - This test ensures that progress counter is incremented by 1 when `progress_()` function is called.
2. `testProgressTrackerIsCalledEvery1024Increments()` - This test ensures that progress tracker is only called every 1024 increments of progress counter.
3. `testProgressThrowsRuntimeExceptionIfProgressTrackerReturnsFalse()` - This test ensures that `progress_()` throws a RuntimeException if the progress tracker returns false.

We have also created two classes:

1. `Progress` - This class contains the original `progress_()` function and a getter method for progress counter.
2. `MockProgressTracker` - This class implements the `ProgressTracker` interface and allows us to mock the behaviour of the progress tracker. This class also contains a boolean variable to check if `progress()` method is called.

# Refactoring

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent code. Keep the method signature as it is just modify the contents of the function.

Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient. 

```

private void progress_() {
		m_progress_counter++;
		if (m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0) {
			if ((m_progress_tracker != null)
					&& !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)))
				throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
		}
	}

```

Here's a more efficient and semantically equivalent version of the function:

```java
private void progress_() {
    if (++m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0 && m_progress_tracker != null) {
        if (!m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)) {
            throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
        }
    }
}
```

Using pre-increment (`++m_progress_counter`) instead of post-increment (`m_progress_counter++`) can help improve efficiency. This is because pre-increment increments the variable before it is used in the comparison, while post-increment increments the variable after it is used in the comparison.

Also, checking ```m_progress_tracker``` for `null` before calling the `progress()` method can help prevent a `NullPointerException`.
