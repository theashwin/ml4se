# Refactoring

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent code. Keep the method signature as it is just modify the contents of the function.

Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

Here's a more efficient and readable implementation of the given function:

```java
public static long bytesToLong(byte[] b) {
    long result = 0;
    int shiftAmount = 0;
    for (int i = b.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        result |= ((long) (b[i] & 0xff)) << shiftAmount;
        shiftAmount += 8;
    }
    return result;
}
```

This implementation uses a loop to iterate over the bytes in the array and shift them into the correct position in the resulting long variable. It also bit-masks the byte values with `0xff` to ensure that they are interpreted as unsigned values, and initializes `shiftAmount` to 0 instead of using hardcoded shift values which makes it more flexible if the length of the input byte array changes.
