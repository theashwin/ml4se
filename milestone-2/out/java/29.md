# Refactoring

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent code. Keep the method signature as it is just modify the contents of the function.

Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

```
public Point getCoordinate() throws GeometryException {
    if (m_coordinate == null) {
        throw new GeometryException("invalid call");
    }

    return new Point(m_coordinate);
}
```

The refactored code checks if `m_coordinate` is null instead of calling the `isEmpty()` method. This is because the `isEmpty()` method may have a different definition depending on the context and is not a standard method of the `Point` class. 

The `new Point(m_coordinate)` constructor is used instead of `new Point(m_coordinate.x, m_coordinate.y)` since it is more concise and ensures that all fields of the `Point` object are correctly initialized. 

Also, the `GeometryException` is thrown only when necessary to ensure that the function is efficient.
