# Refactoring

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent code. Keep the method signature as it is just modify the contents of the function.

Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

Here is the semantically equivalent code:

```java
private int calcN_() {
    final int minN = 4;
    double cos_a = 1 - (m_densify_dist * Math.abs(m_abs_distance_reversed));
    double N = (cos_a < -1) ? minN : 2.0 * Math.PI / Math.acos(cos_a) + 0.5;
    return (int) Math.max(minN, Math.min(N, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle));
}
```

I made the following changes:

- Removed the comment as it explains nothing that isn't already evident in the code.
- Removed the `if` statement that checks for `m_densify_dist == 0` as it is redundant. If `m_densify_dist` is 0, `cos_a` will be 1 and the code will compute `N` as if `m_densify_dist` is not 0.
- Combined the `if` and `else` block into a ternary expression that computes `N`.
- Removed the `if` statement that checks if `N < minN` because we already set `N` to `minN` if `cos_a < -1`.
- Added a call to `Math.max` to ensure that `N` is at least `minN` and a call to `Math.min` to ensure that `N` is at most `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle`.
- Removed the `r` variable since it is used only once in the calculation.
- Parenthesized the expression `(int) N` for readability. 

As for efficiency, the changes I made are more about readability and simplification than performance. The performance of the code should not be affected by these changes.
