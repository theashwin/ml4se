# Refactoring

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent code. Keep the method signature as it is just modify the contents of the function.

Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

Here's the modified implementation of the same function:

```
public static double scal(GraphicPoint pt1, GraphicPoint pt2, GraphicPoint pt3, GraphicPoint pt4) {
    double xDiff1 = pt2.x - pt1.x;
    double xDiff2 = pt4.x - pt3.x;
    double yDiff1 = pt2.y - pt1.y;
    double yDiff2 = pt4.y - pt3.y;

    return ((xDiff1 * xDiff2) + (yDiff1 * yDiff2));
}
```

In this modified implementation, we have added variables `xDiff1, xDiff2, yDiff1, yDiff2` to hold the differences between the `x` and `y` coordinates of the input points. We then use these variables in the return statement to calculate the result. This implementation is more readable, easier to maintain and more efficient as we are only calculating the differences once per input pair, rather than repeatedly.

Note: Please make sure to import the `GraphicPoint` class at the top of your file or change the parameter types to existing classes in your project.
