# Refactoring

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent code. Keep the method signature as it is just modify the contents of the function.

Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

The given function `getDimension()` returns a constant value '1'. Hence, we can simply replace the function with a statement that returns '1'. 

Refactored function:
```
public int getDimension() {
    return 1;
}
```

We can also write the same function in a single line and remove unnecessary braces, as follows:
```
public int getDimension() { return 1; }
```

This function is already efficient as it just returns the constant value 1, which is a very simple operation and takes constant time. Hence there is no scope to improve the efficiency of this function.
