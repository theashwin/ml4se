# Refactoring

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent code. Keep the method signature as it is just modify the contents of the function.

Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

One possible solution is:

```java
public static String extension(String path) {
    int extIndex = path.lastIndexOf(".");
    if (extIndex < 0 || extIndex == path.length() - 1) {
        return "";
    }
    return path.substring(extIndex);
}
```

Explanation:
- The method `extension` takes a `path` argument, which is assumed to be a file path or name.
- The first line of the refactored method finds the last dot (`.`) in the `path` by calling `lastIndexOf(".")`. Since the dot is a special character in regex, it needs to be escaped with a backslash (`\`), but we can use the string literal `.` instead, since `lastIndexOf` also accepts a plain string. If there's no dot in the `path`, `lastIndexOf` returns `-1`.
- The second line checks if `extIndex` is less than zero, which means no dot is found, or if the dot is at the end of the string, which means the `path` ends with a dot and has no extension. In either case, an empty string is returned.
- The last line returns the substring of `path` starting from `extIndex` to the end of the string, which represents the extension including the dot. If `extIndex` is equal to zero, the substring starts from the first character, which is also a dot, but that's okay as long as the extension is empty.
- Note that we don't need to call `name` function, since we can directly work with the `path` string. Also, we don't need to use the `EXTENSION_SEPARATOR` constant, since we can use the plain dot instead. Finally, we can check for the edge case of the dot at the end of the string without subtracting 1 from `length()`, since `substring` handles it correctly by returning an empty string.
