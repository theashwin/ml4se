# Refactoring

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent code. Keep the method signature as it is just modify the contents of the function.

Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

One possible refactor of the code could be as follows:

```java
public static String getTimeString(long timeMillis) {
    if (timeMillis < 10000) {
        return String.format("%d ms", timeMillis);
    } else {
        double seconds = timeMillis / 1000.0;
        return String.format("%.3f s", seconds);
    }
}
```

This code uses an `if/else` statement instead of the ternary operator `? :` for readability. It also uses `String.format` to create the output string with proper formatting. Finally, it calculates the seconds value once, rather than repeating the calculation in both branches of the `? :` operator.
