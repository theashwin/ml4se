# Refactoring

---

For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent code. Keep the method signature as it is just modify the contents of the function.

Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

```
static int hash(int hashIn, int n) {
    int hash = hashIn;
    int c = n & 0xFF;
    hash = hash * 33 + c;
    c = (n >> 8) & 0xFF;
    hash = hash * 33 + c;
    c = (n >> 16) & 0xFF;
    hash = hash * 33 + c;
    c = (n >> 24) & 0xFF;
    hash = hash * 33 + c;
    return hash & 0x7FFFFFFF;
}
```
The refactored code will initialize the `hash` variable with the `hashIn` parameter, and use a separate variable `c` to store the `n` parameter bitwise ANDed with a hexadecimal value of `0xFF`. Then the `c` variable is added to the `hash` variable that's left shifted by 5 then added to itself, similar to `hash = hash * 33 + c`. The four lines that update `hash` with `n`'s four bytes are equivalent to updating `hash` with the four separate `c` values using the formula given. Finally, the `hash` is bitwise ANDed with a hexadecimal value of `0x7FFFFFFF` to ensure that it is non-negative, and is returned. This code is more readable while also being efficient as it has the same time complexity as the previous implementation.
