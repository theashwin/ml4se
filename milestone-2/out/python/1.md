For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Step by step. Be as specific as possible. Assume variable's contents as required. 

code: epsilon = sqrt(finfo(float).eps)


def plogdet(K):
    r"""Log of the pseudo-determinant.
    It assumes that ``K`` is a positive semi-definite matrix.
    Args:

    Returns:
        float: log of the pseudo-determinant.

| **Input** | **Output** | 
| --------- | ---------- |
| K = [[1,0],[0,1]] | 0.0 |
| K = [[4, 12], [12, 36]] | 3.806662 |
| K = [[1,2,3],[2,4,5],[3,5,6]] | 1.098612 | 

Assuming that `finfo(float).eps = 2.220446049250313e-16`:
- For input K = [[1,0],[0,1]], `eigvalsh(K)` will return [1.0, 1.0] since the given input matrix is an identity matrix. The variable `epsilon` will be `sqrt(2.220446049250313e-16) = 1.4901161193847656e-08`. Since all the eigenvalues are greater than `epsilon`, only the `log` of 1 eigenvalue is considered. Hence the output is `0.0`.
- For input K = [[4, 12], [12, 36]], `eigvalsh(K)` will return [0.0, 40.0] since it is a positive semi-definite matrix. `epsilon` will be `sqrt(2.220446049250313e-16) = 1.4901161193847656e-08`. The only eigenvalue greater than `epsilon` is 40.0. So, the output is `np.log(40.0) = 3.806662`.
- For input K = [[1,2,3],[2,4,5],[3,5,6]], `eigvalsh(K)` will return [-0.5157..., 0.1709..., 10.344....] since it is a positive semi-definite matrix. `epsilon` will be `sqrt(2.220446049250313e-16) = 1.4901161193847656e-08`. Only the largest eigenvalue (10.344...) is greater than `epsilon`. So, the output is `np.log(10.344...) = 1.098612`. 

The `plogdet()` function returns the `log` of the pseudo-determinant of the given matrix `K` provided that the matrix is positive semi-definite. The eigenvalues of the matrix are calculated using the `eigvalsh()` function which sorts the eigenvalues in ascending order. Then, the `log` of the eigenvalues greater than `epsilon` are summed up and returned.

Show calculations for each of the three input-output pairs. Step by step. 

Sure. 

For input K = [[1,0],[0,1]], 

- The eigenvalues of the matrix K can be calculated using `eigvalsh(K)`.
- It returns `[1.0, 1.0]` as `K` is an identity matrix.
- Next, we calculate `epsilon = sqrt(finfo(float).eps) = sqrt(2.220446049250313e-16) = 1.4901161193847656e-08`.
- Since both the eigenvalues are greater than `epsilon`, we consider `log` of only one of the eigenvalues. Hence, the output is `log(npsum([1.0]))` which is `0.0`.

For input K = [[4, 12], [12, 36]], 

- The eigenvalues of the matrix K can be calculated using `eigvalsh(K)`.
- It returns `[0.0, 40.0]`.
- Next, we calculate `epsilon = sqrt(finfo(float).eps) = sqrt(2.220446049250313e-16) = 1.4901161193847656e-08`.
- Only the eigenvalue 40.0 is greater than `epsilon`. So, we consider its `log`. Hence, the output is `log(npsum([40.0]))` which is `3.806662`.

For input K = [[1,2,3],[2,4,5],[3,5,6]], 

- The eigenvalues of the matrix K can be calculated using `eigvalsh(K)`.
- It returns `[-0.5157..., 0.1709..., 10.344....]`.
- Next, we calculate `epsilon = sqrt(finfo(float).eps) = sqrt(2.220446049250313e-16) = 1.4901161193847656e-08`.
- Only the largest eigenvalue (10.344...) is greater than `epsilon`. So, we consider its `log`. Hence, the output is `log(npsum([10.344...]))` which is `1.098612`.
