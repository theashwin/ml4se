# Reasoning

---

For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Step by step. Be as specific as possible. Assume variable's contents as required. 

code: private void progress_() {
		m_progress_counter++;
		if (m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0) {
			if ((m_progress_tracker != null)
					&& !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)))
				throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
		}
	}

| Input | Output | Reasoning |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| m_progress_counter = 0, m_progress_tracker = null | m_progress_counter = 1 | The function increments the value of `m_progress_counter` by 1. Since the value of `m_progress_counter` is not divisible by 1024, the condition `m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0` is not true and the function does not throw a `RuntimeException`. |
| m_progress_counter = 1023, m_progress_tracker = progress_tracker | m_progress_counter = 1024 | The function increments the value of `m_progress_counter` by 1. Since the value of `m_progress_counter` is now divisible by 1024, the condition `m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0` is true and the function checks if `m_progress_tracker` is not null and if the function call `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)` fails. If the call returns false, then the function throws a `RuntimeException` with the message "user_canceled". |
| m_progress_counter = 1024, m_progress_tracker = progress_tracker | RuntimeException with message "user_canceled" | The function increments the value of `m_progress_counter` by 1. Since the value of `m_progress_counter` is now divisible by 1024, the condition `m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0` is true and the function checks if `m_progress_tracker` is not null and if the function call `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)` fails. If the call returns false, then the function throws a `RuntimeException` with the message "user_canceled". Since there is no catch block to handle the exception, the function will terminate immediately and the exception will be propagated up the call stack (if there is one). | 

The function `progress_()` increments the value of `m_progress_counter` by 1 on each execution. If the value of `m_progress_counter` is a multiple of 1024 and `m_progress_tracker` is not null, the function calls the `progress()` method on the `m_progress_tracker` object with the arguments `-1` and `-1`. If the call to `progress()` returns false, the function throws a `RuntimeException` with the message "user_canceled". If the call to `progress()` returns true or if `m_progress_tracker` is null, the function does not throw any exception.

Show calculations for each of the three input-output pairs. Step by step. 

1. Input: `m_progress_counter` = 0, `m_progress_tracker` = null

   Execution:
   
   - `m_progress_counter++` will execute, incrementing `m_progress_counter` to 1.
   - The condition `m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0` is false because `m_progress_counter` is not a multiple of 1024.
   - The expression `(m_progress_tracker != null) && !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1))` is not evaluated because `m_progress_tracker` is null.
   - The function does not throw an exception.
   
   Output: `m_progress_counter` = 1


2. Input: `m_progress_counter` = 1023, `m_progress_tracker` = `progress_tracker`

   Execution:
   
   - `m_progress_counter++` will execute, incrementing `m_progress_counter` to 1024.
   - The condition `m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0` is true because `m_progress_counter` is a multiple of 1024.
   - The expression `(m_progress_tracker != null) && !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1))` will execute because `m_progress_tracker` is not null.
   - The `progress(-1, -1)` method is called on `m_progress_tracker`, passing `-1` as the values for progress and total. If this method returns `false`, a `RuntimeException` with message "user_canceled" is thrown.
   - The method does not return, since a `RuntimeException` is thrown.
   
   Output: A `RuntimeException` with message "user_canceled" is thrown.


3. Input: `m_progress_counter` = 1024, `m_progress_tracker` = `progress_tracker`

   Execution:
   
   - `m_progress_counter++` will execute, incrementing `m_progress_counter` to 1025.
   - The condition `m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0` is false because `m_progress_counter` is not a multiple of 1024.
   - The expression `(m_progress_tracker != null) && !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1))` is not evaluated because the condition in the previous step is false.
   - The function does not throw an exception.
   
   Output: `m_progress_counter` = 1025
