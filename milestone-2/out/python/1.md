|C|Matrix representing data|2D numpy array|[[9,10],[11,12]]|
|out|Output array with the result of the computation|2D numpy array|[[0,0],[0,0]]|

Input:
```
A = [[1,2],[3,4]]
B = [[5,6],[7,8]]
C = [[9,10],[11,12]]
out = [[0,0],[0,0]]
```
Output:

```

Input:
```
A = [[2,4],[6,8]]
B = [[1,3],[5,7]]

out = [[0,0],[0,0]]
```
Output:
```
[[ 70., 150.],
 [150., 334.]]
```

Input:
```
A = [[2,3],[4,5]]

```
[[ 23.,  33.],
 [ 37.,  53.]]
```

Explanation of the function:
1. The `kron_dot` function takes in three input matrices `A`,`B` and `C`.
2. It imports the `numpy` library functions `dot`, `zeros` and `asarray`.
3. The `asarray` function converts the input matrices `A`,`B` and `C` into numpy arrays if they are not already numpy arrays.
4. The `if` statement checks if the `out` parameter is `None`. If it is, it initializes the `out` parameter with a 2D numpy array of zeros with shape `B.shape[0], A.shape[0]`.
5. The `dot` function applies matrix multiplication on `B` and the matrix resultant of `C` and the transpose of `A`. This multiplication is assigned to the `out` variable. 
6. `out` is returned as the final output.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Input 1:
```
A = [[1,2],[3,4]]
B = [[5,6],[7,8]]
C = [[9,10],[11,12]]
out = [[0,0],[0,0]]
```
Output:
```
[[ 63.,  81.],
 [ 87., 111.]]
```
Calculations:
- `A` has shape `(2,2)` and `B` has shape `(2,2)`
- `C` has shape `(2,2)` and the transpose of `A` has shape `(2,2)`
- `out` is initialized to have shape `(2,2)`
- `B` is first multiplied by the dot product of `C` and `A.T`, which is `(C.A.T)` giving:
```
[[63 81]
 [87 111]]
```
- The output is equal to the resulting matrix `C.A.T.B`, which is `[[63, 81], [87, 111]]`

Execution Reasoning:
The function initializes `out` matrix from the default matrix of zeros of shape `(2,2)` because the `out` parameter has been set to `None`. Then, the function assigns the matrix multiplication of `B` and the dot product of `C` and `A.T` to `out`. In the input `(A,B,C)`, `A`,`B` and `C` values are the same size and arranged as 2D numpy arrays of size `(2,2)`. Therefore, matrix multiplication is possible and the final output is `[[63, 81], [87, 111]]`.


Input 2:
```
A = [[2,4],[6,8]]
B = [[1,3],[5,7]]
C = [[2,1],[1,2]]
out = [[0,0],[0,0]]
```
Output:
```
[[ 70., 150.],
 [150., 334.]]
```
Calculations:
- `A` has shape `(2,2)` and `B` has shape `(2,2)`
- `C` has shape `(2,2)` and the transpose of `A` has shape `(2,2)`
- `out` is initialized to have shape `(2,2)`
- `B` is first multiplied by the dot product of `C` and `A.T`, which is `(C.A.T)` giving:
```
[[22 56]
 [42 96]]
```
- The output is equal to the resulting matrix `C.A.T.B`, which is `[[70, 150], [150, 334]]`

Execution Reasoning:
The function initializes `out` matrix from the default matrix of zeros of shape `(2,2)` because the `out` parameter has been set to `None`. Then, the function assigns the matrix multiplication of `B` and the dot product of `C` and `A.T` to `out`. In the input `(A,B,C)`, `A`,`B` and `C` values are the same size and arranged as 2D numpy arrays of size `(2,2)`. Therefore, matrix multiplication is possible and the final output is `[[70,150], [150, 334]]`.


Input 3:
```
A = [[2,3],[4,5]]
B = [[1,2],[3,4]]
C = [[3,1],[1,3]]
out = [[0,0],[0,0]]
```
Output:
```
[[ 23.,  33.],
 [ 37.,  53.]]
```
Calculations:
- `A` has shape `(2,2)` and `B` has shape `(2,2)`
- `C` has shape `(2,2)` and the transpose of `A` has shape `(2,2)`
- `out` is initialized to have shape `(2,2)`
- `B` is first multiplied by the dot product of `C` and `A.T`, which is `(C.A.T)` giving:
```
[[23 33]
 [37 53]]
```
- The output is equal to the resulting matrix `C.A.T.B`, which is `[[23, 33], [37, 53]]`

Execution Reasoning:
The function initializes `out` matrix from the default matrix of zeros of shape `(2,2)` because the `out` parameter has been set to `None`. Then, the function assigns the matrix multiplication of `B` and the dot product of `C` and `A.T` to `out`. In the input `(A,B,C)`, `A`,`B` and `C` values are the same size and arranged as 2D numpy arrays of size `(2,2)`. Therefore, matrix multiplication is possible and the final output is `[[23, 33], [37, 53]]`.

## Observations
+ The reasoning is on point, however, the calculations are off which is expected as matrix multiplication is difficult to calculate and transformer based models are not good at calculations.
+ The prompt elicits great input and output pairs with adequate reasoning.
+ This can be considered as "PARTIALLY CORRECT"

# Task 2: Generate Tests

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write unit test for testing the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Import all the required packages, Mock all the functions and classes required by the method.**

**code:**

```

def kron_dot(A, B, C, out=None):
    
    from numpy import dot, zeros, asarray

    A = asarray(A)
    B = asarray(B)
    C = asarray(C)

    if out is None:
        out = zeros((B.shape[0], A.shape[0]))
    dot(B, dot(C, A.T), out=out)
    return out
```

## Response

To unit test the `kron_dot` function, we need to do the following:

1. Import all the required packages
2. Define the test class
3. Mock all the functions and classes required by the method
4. Define the test methods

Here's the test class definition to begin with:
```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from numpy import array, allclose

class TestKronDot(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_kron_dot(self):
        # create sample matrices
        A = array([[1,2],[3,4]])
        B = array([[5,6],[7,8],[9,10]])
        C = array([[11,12],[13,14]])

        # expected output
        expected_output = array([[243, 313],[335, 433],[427, 553]])

        # mock the functions and classes required by kron_dot
        numpy_mock = MagicMock()
        numpy_mock.dot.side_effect = [C, expected_output]
        zeros_mock = MagicMock(return_value=expected_output)
        
        # import the function after the mocks have been set up
        with unittest.mock.patch.dict('sys.modules', numpy=numpy_mock):
            from kron_dot import kron_dot
            
            # call the function to get the actual output
            actual_output = kron_dot(A, B, C, out=None)
            
            # assert the actual and expected outputs
            self.assertTrue(allclose(actual_output, expected_output))
            numpy_mock.dot.assert_called_with(C, A.T)
            zeros_mock.assert_called_with((B.shape[0], A.shape[0]))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

## Prompt

**Refactor the unit test produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.**

## Response

Based on the instructions provided and the code for the function `kron_dot`, we can write the following test cases:

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from numpy import array, allclose

class TestKronDot(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_kron_dot(self):
        # create sample matrices
        A = array([[1,2],[3,4]])
        B = array([[5,6],[7,8],[9,10]])
        C = array([[11,12],[13,14]])

        # expected output
        expected_output = array([[243, 313],[335, 433],[427, 553]])

        # mock the functions and classes required by kron_dot
        numpy_mock = MagicMock()
        numpy_mock.dot.side_effect = [C, expected_output]
        zeros_mock = MagicMock(return_value=expected_output)
        
        # import the function after the mocks have been set up
        with unittest.mock.patch.dict('sys.modules', numpy=numpy_mock):
            from kron_dot import kron_dot
            
            # call the function to get the actual output
            actual_output = kron_dot(A, B, C, out=None)
            
            # assert the actual and expected outputs
            self.assertTrue(allclose(actual_output, expected_output))
            numpy_mock.dot.assert_called_with(C, A.T)
            zeros_mock.assert_called_with((B.shape[0], A.shape[0]))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that we're mocking the `numpy.dot` function and the `numpy.zeros` function since they're being used in the `kron_dot` function.

Also, we're patching the `numpy` module so that the `dot` function from the mock is used instead of the actual `numpy.dot` function.

Finally, we're checking that the `dot` and `zeros` functions are called with the correct parameters.

## Observations
+ Returns ```ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (0,) (3,2)```
+ As we do not give the whole repository the model assumes the location for the method, we replaced it to test the behaviour
+ It is a known fact that transformer based model are terrible at mathematics, this example is not exception matrix multiplication is hard and thus the model fails to generate an adequate test.
+ The prompt elicits great input and output pairs with adequate reasoning.
+ This can be considered as "INCORRECT"

# Task 3: Generate Semantically Equivalent Method

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Method signature should remain identical, Return type of the function should also remain identical, Add comments to the method when required, Add <COMMENTS> to the method.**

**code:**

```

def kron_dot(A, B, C, out=None):
    
    from numpy import dot, zeros, asarray

    A = asarray(A)
    B = asarray(B)
    C = asarray(C)

    if out is None:
        out = zeros((B.shape[0], A.shape[0]))
    dot(B, dot(C, A.T), out=out)
    return out

```

## Response

```
def kron_dot(A: array, B: array, C: array, out: Optional[array]=None) -> array:
    """Returns the matrix multiplication product of `B` and `C x A.T`, or stores it to `out`.
    
    Args:
    A: matrix of shape (m,p)
    B: matrix of shape (n,m)
    C: matrix of shape (n,k)
    out: Optional; matrix of shape (n,p) to store the output
    
    Returns:
    matrix of shape (n,p)
    """
    from numpy import dot, zeros, asarray
    
    A = asarray(A) # convert A to an ndarray
    B = asarray(B) # convert B to an ndarray
    C = asarray(C) # convert C to an ndarray
    
    # If out is None, then create a zeros matrix with dimensions (B shape[0], A shape[0])
    if out is None:
        out = zeros((B.shape[0], A.shape[0]))
        
    # Compute and store the matrix multiplication product B and C x A.T
    dot(B, dot(C, A.T), out=out)
    
    return out # Return the stored or computed matrix multiplication product as a numpy ndarray 
```

## Prompt

**Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.**

## Response

```
import numpy as np

def kron_dot(A: np.ndarray, B: np.ndarray, C: np.ndarray, out: np.ndarray = None) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns the matrix multiplication product of `B` and `C x A.T`, or stores it to `out`.
    
    Args:
    A: matrix of shape (m,p)
    B: matrix of shape (n,m)
    C: matrix of shape (n,k)
    out: Optional; matrix of shape (n,p) to store the output
    
    Returns:
    matrix of shape (n,p)
    """
    
    if out is None:
        out = np.zeros((B.shape[0], A.shape[1]))           #Use shape[1] for p, as that's the second argument of A
    
    np.dot(B, np.dot(C, A.T), out=out)                      #Use np.dot for matrix multiplication
    
    return out 
``` 

The function has been updated to use `numpy` library for its functions instead of invoking them from it, by using `import numpy as np`. Also, unnecessary conversion of matrices `A`, `B` and `C` via `asarray` have been eliminated as they are already being passed as `numpy` ndarrays. Use of `'dot'` has been substituted with `np.dot` for matrix multiplication to improve efficiency. Further, the dimension argument in the purchase row of `out` has also been corrected to use `shape[1]` for the dimension `p`.

## Observations
+ This generated method is on point, it passed existing test cases that were present in the test suite.
+ This can be considered as "CORRECT", also the reasoning after refactoring is on point.
