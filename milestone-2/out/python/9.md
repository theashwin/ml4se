# Task 1: Reasoning

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```

from numpy import abs as _abs
from numpy import sum as _sum
from numpy import arange, asarray, log, prod, sign


def lu_slogdet(LU):
    LU = (asarray(LU[0], float), asarray(LU[1], float))
    adet = _sum(log(_abs(LU[0].diagonal())))

    s = prod(sign(LU[0].diagonal()))

    nrows_exchange = LU[1].size - _sum(LU[1] == arange(LU[1].size, dtype="int32"))

    odd = nrows_exchange % 2 == 1
    if odd:
        s *= -1.0

    return (s, adet)

```

## Response

Table of Inputs and Outputs: 

| Input | Data Type | Output | Data Type |
|-------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| [[1, 2], [3, 4]]| List | (1.0, log(4.0))| Tuple |
| [[0, 2], [3, 4]]| List | (-1.0, log(0.0)) | Tuple |
| [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 10]]| List | (1.0, log(15))| Tuple |

Reasoning about the Execution of the Function:
- The function uses the concept of LU decomposition to factorize a matrix into lower and upper triangle matrices.
- The LU matrix is passed to the function as an argument.
- Then, the function performs several calculations on the LU matrix.
- First, it converts the integer values in the LU matrix to float by converting them to numpy arrays.
- Then, it calculates the absolute value of the diagonal elements of the lower triangle matrix, takes the logarithm of the absolute values, and calculates the sum of the logarithms. This computation gives the 'adet' value.
- The function then computes a 's' value that determines whether the LU matrix is positive or negative.
- Next, it determines the number of exchanges of rows needed to make the LU matrix lower triangle matrix into a diagonal matrix.
- If the number of exchanges is odd, the 's' value is multiplied by -1 to change the sign.
- Finally, the function returns the tuple of 's' and 'adet' values.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. Input: [[1, 2], [3, 4]] 
    - The input is a 2x2 matrix with values [1, 2] and [3, 4].
    - First, the function converts the integer values to float and stores them in a tuple.
    - The LU decomposition is performed on the input matrix to get LU = ([3., 4.], [[ 0.,          1.        ], [ 1.,          0.        ]]).
    - The absolute values of the diagonal elements of the lower triangle matrix [3., 0.] are computed and their log values are also computed, and their sum is taken to get adet = log(3.0) + log(4.0) = log(12.0).
    - The sign of the diagonal elements of the lower triangle matrix is calculated using sign([3., 0.]) giving s = 1.0.
    - Since the number of row exchanges required to convert [[3., 4.], [0., -2.]] to an upper triangular form is even, s remains unchanged.
    - Therefore, the function returns the tuple (s, adet), which is (1.0, log(12.0)).

2. Input: [[0, 2], [3, 4]]
    - The input is a 2x2 matrix with values [0, 2] and [3, 4].
    - First, the function converts the integer values to float and stores them in a tuple.
    - The LU decomposition is performed on the input matrix to get LU = ([3.0, 4.0], [[ 0.,          1.        ], [ 1.        ,          0.        ]]).
    - The absolute values of the diagonal elements of the lower triangle matrix [3., 0.] are computed and their log values are also computed, and their sum is taken to get adet = log(3.0) + log(4.0) = log(12.0).
    - The sign of the diagonal elements of the lower triangle matrix is calculated using sign([3., 0.]) giving s = 0.0, as there is a zero in the diagonal, so the whole matrix is zero.
    - Since the number of row exchanges required to convert [[3., 4.], [0., -2.]] to an upper triangular form is odd, s changes sign to -1.0.
    - Therefore, the function returns the tuple (s, adet), which is (-1.0, log(12.0)).

3. Input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 10]]
    - The input is a 3x3 matrix with values [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], and [7, 8, 10].
    - First, the function converts the integer values to float and stores them in a tuple.
    - The LU decomposition is performed on the input matrix to get LU = ([ 7.0,          8.,         10.], [ [0.14285714, 1.        ,         0.        ], [0.57142857, 0.5       ,         1.        ], [1.        , 0.16666667, -0.33333333]]).
    - The absolute values of the diagonal elements of the lower triangle matrix [7., 0.5, 0.3333] are computed and their log values are also computed, and their sum is taken to get adet = log(7.0) + log(0.5) + log(0.3333) = log(1.166446).
    - The sign of the diagonal elements of the lower triangle matrix is calculated using sign([7., 0.5, -0.3333]) giving s = -1.0, as there are two negative values in the diagonal.
    - Since the number of row exchanges required to convert [[ 7.        , 8.        , 10.        ], [ 0.57142857, 1.        , 0.875     ], [ 0.14285714, 0.        , 0.54166667]] to an upper triangular form is odd, s changes sign to 1.0.
    - Therefore, the function returns the tuple (s, adet), which is (1.0, log(1.166446)).

## Observations
+ The reasoning is on point and the calculation for this case is also correct as the maths for this problem is not that difficult.
+ The prompt elicits great input and output pairs with adequate reasoning.
+ This can be considered as "CORRECT"

# Task 2: Generate Tests

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write unit test for testing the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Import all the required packages, Mock all the functions and classes required by the method.**

**code:**

```

from numpy import abs as _abs
from numpy import sum as _sum
from numpy import arange, asarray, log, prod, sign


def lu_slogdet(LU):
    LU = (asarray(LU[0], float), asarray(LU[1], float))
    adet = _sum(log(_abs(LU[0].diagonal())))

    s = prod(sign(LU[0].diagonal()))

    nrows_exchange = LU[1].size - _sum(LU[1] == arange(LU[1].size, dtype="int32"))

    odd = nrows_exchange % 2 == 1
    if odd:
        s *= -1.0

    return (s, adet)

```

## Response

Firstly, let's write the unit test for the above function. We will use the `unittest` module to write the test cases. 

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestLuSlogdet(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('numpy.abs')
    @patch('numpy.sum')
    @patch('numpy.arange')
    @patch('numpy.asarray')
    @patch('numpy.log')
    @patch('numpy.prod')
    @patch('numpy.sign')
    def test_lu_slogdet(self, mock_sign, mock_prod, mock_log, mock_asarray, mock_arange, mock_sum, mock_abs):

        mock_abs.return_value = 2.0
        mock_sum.return_value = 4.0
        mock_arange.return_value = [0, 1, 2, 3]
        mock_asarray.return_value = ([[1, 0], [0.5, 1]], [0, 1])
        mock_log.return_value = 1.0
        mock_prod.return_value = 1.0
        mock_sign.return_value = 1.0

        self.assertEqual(lu_slogdet([[1, 0], [0.5, 1]]), (1.0, 1.0))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

``` 

In the above test case, we have used the `patch` decorator from the `unittest.mock` module to mock all the numpy functions used within the function. We have then set the return values for these mock methods to the values we want to test against. Finally we have called the `lu_slogdet` function with mock input and checked whether the output is correct or not.

## Prompt

**Refactor the unit test produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.**

## Response

Here's an optimized and refactored version of the unit test with some additional test cases.

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestLuSlogdet(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('numpy.abs')
    @patch('numpy.sum')
    @patch('numpy.arange')
    @patch('numpy.asarray')
    @patch('numpy.log')
    @patch('numpy.prod')
    @patch('numpy.sign')
    def test_lu_slogdet(self, mock_sign, mock_prod, mock_log, mock_asarray, mock_arange, mock_sum, mock_abs):

        # Mocking numpy functions in mock methods
        mock_abs.return_value = 2.0
        mock_sum.return_value = 4.0
        mock_arange.return_value = [0, 1, 2, 3]
        mock_asarray.return_value = ([[1, 0], [0.5, 1]], [0, 1])
        mock_log.return_value = 1.0
        mock_prod.return_value = 1.0
        mock_sign.return_value = 1.0

        # Testing for the correct output
        self.assertEqual(lu_slogdet([[1, 0], [0.5, 1]]), (1.0, 1.0))

        # Testing for odd number of row exchanges
        mock_abs.return_value = 3.0
        mock_sum.return_value = 3.0
        mock_arange.return_value = [0, 2, 3, 1]
        mock_asarray.return_value = ([[1, 2], [2, 1]], [0, 2, 3, 1])
        mock_log.return_value = 1.0986122886681098
        mock_prod.return_value = 1.0
        mock_sign.return_value = -1.0
        self.assertEqual(lu_slogdet([[1, 2], [2, 1]]), (-1.0, 1.0986122886681098))

        # Testing with integer inputs
        mock_abs.return_value = 1.0
        mock_sum.return_value = 2.0
        mock_arange.return_value = [0, 1]
        mock_asarray.return_value = ([[1, -1], [2, 3]], [0, 1])
        mock_log.return_value = 0.0
        mock_prod.return_value = 6.0
        mock_sign.return_value = -1.0
        self.assertEqual(lu_slogdet([[1, -1], [2, 3]]), (-1.0, 0.0))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this refactored version of the code, we have added two additional test cases to test for odd number of row exchanges and integer inputs. We have also grouped all the mock method calls and test cases together in the `test_lu_slogdet` function, which makes it more efficient to read and run. Finally, we have added a `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to run the test case when the script is executed.

## Observations
- Following the common theme for this project, the generated test is correct but maths is not.
- Asserts fail for majority of the cases.
- Can be termed as "PARTIALLY CORRECT"

# Task 3: Generate Semantically Equivalent Method

``` 

I have modified the function to:
- Import NumPy as np instead of importing specific functions using renaming with `_` to better follow the usual practice.
- Change the signatures of the imported modules.
- Convert the input matrices to NumPy arrays.
- Replace the use of sum() and prod() functions for NP sum() and prod() functions respectively.
- Use NumPy `np.diag()` instead of indexing only the diagonal of the matrix.
- Simplify `if odd` to a single line of code.

## Observations
+ This generated method is on point, it passed all existing test cases that were present in the test suite.
+ This can be considered as "CORRECT", also the reasoning after refactoring is on point.
+ Refactored method is also runs and passed all cases.
