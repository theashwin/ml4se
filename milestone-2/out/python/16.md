## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```

from numpy import asarray, finfo, logical_not, sqrt
from numpy.linalg import eigh, svd
def economic_qs(K, epsilon=sqrt(finfo(float).eps)):
    (S, Q) = eigh(K)

    nok = abs(max(Q[0].min(), Q[0].max(), key=abs)) < epsilon
    nok = nok and abs(max(K.min(), K.max(), key=abs)) >= epsilon
    if nok:
        from scipy.linalg import eigh as sp_eigh

        (S, Q) = sp_eigh(K)

    ok = S >= epsilon
    nok = logical_not(ok)
    S0 = S[ok]
    Q0 = Q[:, ok]
    Q1 = Q[:, nok]
    return ((Q0, Q1), S0)

```

## Response

Input:

K = [ [2.5, 1.2, 0.7],
       [1.2, 2.8, 1.7],
       [0.7, 1.7, 1.3] ]

epsilon = 0.01


Execution:

- In the first line, we imported the required libraries and defined a function called 'economic_qs' with two parameters 'K' and 'epsilon'.

- Inside the function, the numpy method 'eigh' is used to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix 'K'. 

- We calculate the value of 'nok', which is true if the maximum absolute value of min and max of the first row of matrix 'Q' is less than epsilon value we set.

- Next, we check if 'nok' is true and if the maximum absolute value of min and max of matrix 'K' is greater than or equal to the epsilon value we set. If both the conditions hold true, we calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors again with 'eigh' method from the scipy library.

- We calculate 'ok' which is a boolean array that represents whether the eigenvalue is greater or equal to the epsilon value we set.

- We calculate 'nok' which is a boolean array that represents whether eigenvalue is less than epsilon value we set. 

- We use 'ok' to slice and copy the corresponding rows and columns from matrices 'Q' and 'S' to new matrices 'Q0' and 'S0'. 

- We use 'nok' to slice and copy the corresponding rows and columns from matrix 'Q' to new matrix 'Q1'.

- Finally we return a tuple with two elements. The first element is a tuple that contains matrices Q0 and Q1, and the second element is a matrix S0.

Output:

((array([[-0.34073843,  0.57157208],
        [-0.4888702 ,  0.03753714],
        [-0.80239903, -0.81932082]]),
  array([[-0.54014911],
        [ 0.36648963],
        [ 0.75437437]])),
 array([0.45453914, 3.1018875 ]))

Note: Here the output is rounded off to 8 decimal places.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Input 1:

K = [ [2.5, 1.2, 0.7],
   [1.2, 2.8, 1.7],
   [0.7, 1.7, 1.3] ]

epsilon = 0.01

We pass the above value of 'K' and 'epsilon' to the function 'economic_qs'. Here, in the beginning, we imported the required libraries and defined a function called 'economic_qs' with two parameters 'K' and 'epsilon'. 

Inside the function, in the first line of code, the numpy method called 'eigh' is used to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix 'K'. 

S, Q = eigh(K)

The output of this step is as follows:

S = array([0.45453914, 1.37892686, 4.4680869 ])
Q = array([[-0.34073843,  0.57157208,  0.74681938],
       [-0.4888702 ,  0.03753714, -0.87158109],
       [-0.80239903, -0.81932082,  0.40824829]])

Before going further, we need to calculate a boolean value 'nok' that checks whether the maximum absolute value of min and max elements of the first row of matrix 'Q' is less than epsilon.

nok = abs(max(Q[0].min(), Q[0].max(), key=abs)) < epsilon

In this case, the value of 'nok' is True, which means the accuracy of the calculation is low.

Next, we check if 'nok' is True and if the maximum absolute value of min and max of matrix 'K' is greater than or equal to the epsilon value we set. 

nok = nok and abs(max(K.min(), K.max(), key=abs)) >= epsilon

Here, the value of 'nok' is also True, which means the accuracy of the calculation is low, and the condition evaluates to True.

So, we calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors again with 'eigh' method from the scipy library.

(S, Q) = sp_eigh(K)

Then, we recalculate the value of 'ok' which is a Boolean array that represents whether the eigenvalue is greater than or equal to the epsilon value we set. 

ok = S >= epsilon

This gives the following value for 'ok':

ok = array([False,  True,  True])

We also calculate 'nok' which is a Boolean array that represents whether an eigenvalue is less than epsilon value we set. 

nok = logical_not(ok)

This gives the following value for 'nok':

nok = array([ True, False, False])

We use 'ok' to slice and copy the corresponding rows and columns from matrices 'Q' and 'S' to new matrices 'Q0' and 'S0'.

S0 = S[ok]
Q0 = Q[:, ok]

This gives the following output, which is the first element of the tuple that we will be returning: 

Q0 = array([[-0.34073843,  0.57157208],
       [-0.4888702 ,  0.03753714],
       [-0.80239903, -0.81932082]])

S0 = array([1.37892686, 4.4680869 ])

We use 'nok' to slice and copy the corresponding rows and columns from matrix 'Q' to new matrix 'Q1'.

Q1 = Q[:, nok]

This gives the following output, which is the second element of the tuple that we will be returning: 

Q1 = array([[ 0.74681938],
       [-0.87158109],
       [ 0.40824829]])

So the final output is:

((array([[-0.34073843,  0.57157208],
        [-0.4888702 ,  0.03753714],
        [-0.80239903, -0.81932082]]),
  array([[ 0.74681938],
        [-0.87158109],
        [ 0.40824829]])),
 array([1.37892686, 4.4680869 ]))

Here Q0 represents the orthogonal eigenvector matrix whose columns span the subspace of 'K', having nonzero eigenvalues, while Q1 contains the orthogonal eigenvector matrix whose columns span the subspace of 'K', having zero eigenvalues. Thus, Q0 and Q1 are partitions of the matrix of eigenvectors 'Q', and S0 is the vector of nonzero eigenvalues. 

Input 2:

K = [ [1, 2, 3, 4],
   [4, 5, 6, 7],
   [7, 8, 9, 1],
   [2, 5, 7, 8] ]

epsilon = 0.1

We pass the above value of 'K' and 'epsilon' as inputs to the function 'economic_qs'.

Inside the function, first, we use the numpy function 'eigh' to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix 'K'. 

S, Q = eigh(K)

This gives the following output:

S = array([-9.98610387e-01,  1.68779532e-01,  3.97897144e+00,  1.42361159e+01])
Q = array([[-0.20347417,  0.76571162, -0.60108293, -0.02295828],
       [-0.51586193,  0.11402794,  0.22576985,  0.8171914 ],
       [-0.69391393, -0.61520124, -0.32968452, -0.12186884],
       [-0.43924184,  0.17023652,  0.72254245, -0.51087572]])

Before, we get the value of 'nok', a boolean value that checks whether the maximum absolute value of min and max elements of the first row of matrix 'Q' is less than epsilon. 

nok = abs(max(Q[0].min(), Q[0].max(), key=abs)) < epsilon

The value of 'nok' is False, which means the accuracy of calculation is high.

Next, we calculate the value of 'ok', a boolean array that represents whether the eigenvalue is greater than or equal to the epsilon value we set. 

ok = S >= epsilon

This gives the following Boolean array as output:

ok = array([False, False,  True,  True])

We also calculate 'nok' which is a boolean array that represents whether the eigenvalue is less than the epsilon value we set. 

nok = logical_not(ok)

This gives the following Boolean array as output:

nok = array([ True,  True, False, False])

We use 'ok' to slice and copy the corresponding rows and columns from matrices 'Q' and 'S' to new matrices 'Q0' and 'S0'.

S0 = S[ok]
Q0 = Q[:, ok]

This gives the following output for S0 and Q0. This is the first element of the tuple that we will be returning. 

Q0 = array([[-0.20347417,  0.76571162],
       [-0.51586193,  0.11402794],
       [-0.69391393, -0.61520124],
       [-0.43924184,  0.17023652]])
      
S0 = array([-9.98610387e-01,  1.68779532e-01])

We use 'nok' to slice and copy the corresponding rows and columns from matrix 'Q' to new matrix 'Q1'.

Q1 = Q[:, nok]

This gives the following output for Q1. This is the second element of the tuple that we will be returning.

Q1 = array([[-0.60108293, -0.02295828],
       [ 0.22576985,  0.8171914 ],
       [-0.32968452, -0.12186884],
       [ 0.72254245, -0.51087572]])

So the final output is:

((array([[-0.20347417,  0.76571162],
        [-0.51586193,  0.11402794],
        [-0.69391393, -0.61520124],
        [-0.43924184,  0.17023652]]),
  array([[-0.60108293, -0.02295828],
        [ 0.22576985,  0.8171914 ],
        [-0.32968452, -0.12186884],
        [ 0.72254245, -0.51087572]])),
 array([-9.98610387e-01,  1.68779532e-01]))

Here Q0 represents the orthogonal eigenvector matrix whose columns span the subspace of 'K', having nonzero eigenvalues, while Q1 contains the orthogonal eigenvector matrix whose columns span the subspace of 'K', having zero eigenvalues.

Input 3:

K = [ [6, 2, 5, 4, 8],
   [2, 3, 8, 7, 9],
   [5, 8, 1, 3, 6],
   [4, 7, 3, 9, 1],
   [8, 9, 6, 1, 2] ]

epsilon = 0.001

We pass the above value of 'K' and 'epsilon' as inputs to the function 'economic_qs'.

Inside the function, first, we use the numpy function 'eigh' to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix 'K'.

S, Q = eigh(K)

This gives the following output:

S = array([-1.5847546 , -1.22512381,  4.58619025,  9.60249203, 23.62019614])
Q = array([[-0.19094784, -0.43735294, -0.85543312, -0.07144828,  0.2329802 ],
       [-0.52284504, -0.31850929,  0.0859209 ,  0.50673901, -0.61414395],
       [-0.31969338,  0.74053567, -0.04691562,  0.58004448,  0.12932013],
       [-0.5768829 ,  0.15373449,  0.38387995, -0.62871374, -0.27367285],
       [-0.5045082 , -0.33348094,  0.31473723,  0.20073572,  0.70241552]])

Before calculating other variables, we need to calculate the boolean value 'nok'. 

nok = abs(max(Q[0].min(), Q[0].max(), key=abs)) < epsilon

In this case, the value of 'nok' is False because the maximum absolute value of the first row of matrix 'Q' is greater than epsilon.

Next, we calculate 'ok' which is a boolean array that represents whether the eigenvalue is greater than or equal to the epsilon value we set. 

ok = S >= epsilon

This gives the following Boolean array as output:

ok = array([ True,  True,  True,  True,  True])

We also calculate 'nok' which is a boolean array that represents whether the eigenvalue is less than the epsilon value we set. 

nok = logical_not(ok)

This gives the following Boolean array as output:

nok = array([False, False, False, False, False])

We use 'ok' to slice and copy the corresponding rows and columns from matrices 'Q' and 'S' to new matrices 'Q0' and 'S0'.

S0 = S[ok]
Q0 = Q[:, ok]

This gives the following output for S0 and Q0. This is the first element of the tuple that we will be returning.

Q0 = array([[-0.19094784],
       [-0.52284504],
       [-0.31969338],
       [-0.5768829 ],
       [-0.5045082 ]])

S0 = array([-1.5847546 , -1.22512381,  4.58619025,  9.60249203, 23.62019614])

We use 'nok' to slice and copy the corresponding rows and columns from matrix 'Q' to new matrix 'Q1'.

Q1 = Q[:, nok]

This gives an empty matrix because there are no eigenvalues that are less than the epsilon value we set. So, the output for Q1 will be an empty array.

So the final output is:

((array([[-0.19094784, -0.43735294, -0.85543312, -0.07144828,  0.2329802 ],
         [-0.52284504, -0.31850929,  0.0859209 ,  0.50673901, -0.61414395],
         [-0.31969338,  0.74053567, -0.04691562,  0.58004448,  0.12932013],
         [-0.5768829 ,  0.15373449,  0.38387995, -0.62871374, -0.27367285],
         [-0.5045082 , -0.33348094,  0.31473723,  0.20073572,  0.70241552]]),
  array([])),
 array([-1.5847546 , -1.22512381,  4.58619025,  9.60249203, 23.62019614]))

Here Q0 represents the orthogonal eigenvector matrix whose columns span the subspace of 'K', having nonzero eigenvalues, while Q1 contains the orthogonal eigenvector matrix whose columns span the subspace of 'K', having zero eigenvalues. As we can see, here, Q0 consists of all eigenvectors of matrix 'K' because all of its eigenvalues are greater than or equal to the epsilon value.

## Observations
+ The reasoning is on point, however, the calculations are off which is expected as matrix multiplication is difficult to calculate and transformer based models are not good at calculations.
+ The prompt elicits great input and output pairs with adequate reasoning.
+ This can be considered as "PARTIALLY CORRECT"

```

Note: This is just a sample test case for the given function. You can add more test cases to test the function thoroughly.

## Prompt

**Refactor the unit test produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.**

## Response

Here is the refactored unit test after optimizing it:

```
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch, Mock
import numpy as np

class TestEconomicQs(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls.test_matrix = np.array([
            [4, 5, 6],
            [1, 2, 3],
            [7, 8, 9],
        ])
        cls.expected_output = ((np.array([
            [0, 0],
            [0, 0],
            [0, 0],
        ]), np.array([
            [1, 0],
            [0, 1],
            [0, 0],
        ])), np.array([0, 1, 2]))

    @patch('numpy.linalg.eigh')
    @patch('numpy.finfo')
    @patch('numpy.sqrt')
    def test_economic_qs(self, mock_sqrt, mock_finfo, mock_eigh):
        # Mock return values of mocked functions
        mock_sqrt.return_value = 0.01
        mock_finfo.return_value = Mock(eps=0.0000000001)
        mock_eigh.return_value = (np.array([2, 1, 0]), np.array([
            [1, 0, 0],
            [0, 1, 0],
            [0, 0, 1]
        ]))

        # Call the function
        output = economic_qs(self.test_matrix)

        # Assert the output
        np.testing.assert_array_equal(output, self.expected_output)

    def test_economic_qs_with_real_data(self):
        # Call the function with real data
        matrix = np.array([
            [1.1, 2.2, 3.3],
            [4.4, 5.5, 6.6],
            [7.7, 8.8, 9.9],
        ])
        output = economic_qs(matrix)

        # Assert the output
        assert output[1].shape == (3,)
        assert output[0][0].shape == (3, 2)
        assert output[0][1].shape == (3, 1)
```

In this refactored test case, the test matrix and its expected output are declared in the `setUpClass` method, which is called once before any of the test methods are run. This eliminates the need to redeclare these variables in every test method. 

I have also added a new test method to test the function with real data. This will help ensure that the function works correctly for matrices of different sizes and with non-integer values. 

Finally, I have added assertion statements to check the shape of the output arrays, which provides additional assurance that the output is in the correct format.

## Observations
+ It is a known fact that transformer based model are terrible at mathematics, this example is not exception matrix multiplication is hard and thus the model fails to generate an adequate test.
+ The prompt elicits great input and output pairs with adequate reasoning.
+ This can be considered as "INCORRECT"

``` 

The changes made to code are:

- 'if' condition added to check if epsilon <= 0.0. 
- Removed the import of numpy.sqrt and used np.sqrt() instead.
- Changed 'from numpy import abs' to 'import numpy as np'
- Replaced 'import scipy... eigh' with 'from scipy... import eigh as sp_eigh'
- Removed sorting operation while selecting the eigenvalues greater than or equal to epsilon.
- Removed the redundant variable assignments.

## Observations
+ This generated method is on point, it passed all existing test cases that were present in the test suite.
+ This can be considered as "CORRECT", also the reasoning after refactoring is on point.
+ Refactored method is also runs and passed all cases.
