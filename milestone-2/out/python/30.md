# Reasoning

---

For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Step by step. Be as specific as possible. Assume variable's contents as required.

| Input | limits | inclusive | axis | Output |
|-------|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| [1, 2, 3, 4], <br> 2 | None | (True, True) | None | 2.5 |
| [1,2,3,4], <br> (2, 3) | (True, True) | None | 2.5 |
| [[1, 2, 3], <br> [4, 5, 6]], <br> None | (True, True) | 0 | [2.5, 3.5, 4.5] |


For the first input, function receives a list of 4 elements where limits is not defined, inclusive is true for both start and end of sequence and axis for operation is not defined. The function calculates the mean of all the elements of the list, which results in 2.5.

For the second input, function receives a list of 4 elements , where limits are set to exclude first and last element, inclusive is true for limits and axis is not defined. In this case, first and last elements are masked, so the `mean()` method considers only [2,3] for calculating the mean, which results in 2.5.

For the third input, function recevies a 2d-list of 2x3 elements where limits are not defined, inclusive is true for both start and end of each sub-lists, and axis is set to 0. The function calculates the mean along axis 0 for each column, which results in a list of means of each column: [2.5,3.5,4.5].

Show calculations for each of the three input-output pairs. Step by step. 

#### Input 1:
```
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
limits = None
inclusive = (True, True)
axis = None
```

1. `a` is converted to a numpy array
```
a = np.array(a) # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
2. Since `limits` is None, `np.mean()` is called on `a` and calculated along `axis` (None).
```
mean = np.mean(a, axis) # 2.5
```
3. `mean` is returned

#### Input 2:
```
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
limits = (2, 3)
inclusive = (True, True)
axis = None
```

1. `a` is converted to a numpy array
```
a = np.array(a) # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
2. `_mask_to_limits()` masks any elements of `a` that fall outside of the `limits`, using the `inclusive` argument.
``` 
limits_mask = np.logical_and(a > limits[0], a < limits[1])
inclusive_mask = np.logical_or(a == limits[0], a == limits[1])
mask = np.logical_or(limits_mask, inclusive_mask)
masked_a = np.ma.masked_array(a, mask) # masked_a = [-- 2 3 --]
```
3. The mean along axis `axis` (None) is calculated using the `mean()` method of the masked array. This returns a masked array, which has a `fill_value` set to `numpy.nan`.
```
mean = np.ma.filled(masked_a.mean(axis=axis), fill_value=np.nan) # 2.5
```
4. `mean` is returned.

#### Input 3:
```
a = [[1, 2, 3],
     [4, 5, 6]]
limits = None
inclusive = (True, True)
axis = 0
```

1. `a` is converted to a numpy array
```
a = np.array(a) # [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```
2. Since `limits` is None, the mean is calculated along `axis` (0) using `np.mean()`.
```
mean = np.mean(a, axis=axis) # [2.5, 3.5, 4.5]
```
3. `mean` is returned.

# Tests

---

For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write unit test for testing the function. Import all the required packages and mock all the functions and classes required by the method.

Refactor the unit test produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

Here's a refactored unit test for the `tmean()` function:

```
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
import numpy as np

from your_module import tmean


class TMeanTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_tmean_no_limits(self):
        # Test the function without limits
        # Mock the numpy methods used in tmean()
        with patch('your_module.asarray') as mock_asarray,\
             patch('your_module.np.mean') as mock_mean:
            a = [1, 2, 3]
            axis = None
            mock_asarray.return_value = np.array(a)
            mock_mean.return_value = 2.0

            result = tmean(a=a, limits=None, axis=axis)

            self.assertEqual(result, 2.0)
            mock_asarray.assert_called_once_with(a)
            mock_mean.assert_called_once_with(np.array(a), axis=axis)

    def test_tmean_with_limits(self):
        # Test the function with limits
        # Mock the numpy methods used in tmean()
        with patch('your_module.asarray') as mock_asarray,\
             patch('your_module._mask_to_limits') as mock_mask_to_limits,\
             patch('your_module.np.ma.filled') as mock_filled,\
             patch('your_module.np.nan') as mock_nan:
            a = [1, 2, 3]
            limits = [1.5, 2.5]
            inclusive = (True, True)
            axis = None
            am_mock = MagicMock()
            am_mock.mean.return_value = np.array([2.0])
            mock_asarray.return_value = np.array(a)
            mock_mask_to_limits.return_value = am_mock
            mock_filled.return_value = np.array([2.0])
            mock_nan = np.nan

            result = tmean(a=a, limits=limits, inclusive=inclusive, axis=axis)

            self.assertEqual(result, 2.0)
            mock_asarray.assert_called_once_with(a)
            mock_mask_to_limits.assert_called_once_with(np.array(a), limits, inclusive)
            am_mock.mean.assert_called_once_with(axis=axis)
            mock_filled.assert_called_once_with(np.array([2.0]), fill_value=mock_nan)
```

In this refactored test case, we have:

- Imported the required packages and classes.
- Created a test case class `TMeanTestCase`.
- Defined two test methods: `test_tmean_no_limits()` and `test_tmean_with_limits()`.
- Both tests use the `with patch()` context manager to mock the required functions and classes.
- In order to effectively test the mocked methods, we also create mock return values, and assert that the mocked methods are called with the expected parameters.
- We then run each test method and use `assert` statements to make sure the result is what we expect.
- This approach makes our test case more efficient, because we're only testing the `tmean()` function, and not all the other code in the module as well (which may depend on other libraries).

# Refactoring

---

For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent code. Keep the method signature as it is just modify the contents of the function.

Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient. 

> ### Method under consideration:
> **func_id** : 30 <br/> 
 > **repository** : https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/main/scipy/stats <br/> 
> **location** : scipy/scipy/stats/_stats_py.py  <br/> 
> **flag** : easy <br/>

>> def tmean(a, limits=None, inclusive=(True, True), axis=None):
>    a = asarray(a)
>    if limits is None:
>        return np.mean(a, axis)
>    am = _mask_to_limits(a, limits, inclusive)
>    mean = np.ma.filled(am.mean(axis=axis), fill_value=np.nan)
>    return mean if mean.ndim > 0 else mean.item() 
> ``` 


The refactored code that is semantically equivalent to the given code is:

```python
import numpy as np

def tmean(a, limits=None, inclusive=(True, True), axis=None):
    a = np.asarray(a)
    if limits is None:
        return np.mean(a, axis=axis)
    lower = limits[0] if inclusive[0] else limits[0] + np.finfo(float).eps
    upper = limits[1] if inclusive[1] else limits[1] - np.finfo(float).eps
    mask = np.ma.mask_or(a < lower, a > upper)
    masked_a = np.ma.masked_array(a, mask=mask)
    return np.ma.mean(masked_a, axis=axis).item()
```

The refactored code uses numpy functions and numpy masked arrays to obtain the mean of a given array, masking out values that fall outside of the specified limits. It calculates the lower and upper limits based on whether or not they are inclusive, and creates a mask array using these limits. It then creates a masked array using the original input array and this mask, and returns the mean of this masked array along the specified axis, as a float. This implementation is both efficient and readable.
