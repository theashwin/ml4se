# Task 1: Reasoning

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```

def trimboth(a, proportiontocut, axis=0):
    a = np.asarray(a)

    if a.size == 0:
        return a

    if axis is None:
        a = a.ravel()
        axis = 0

    nobs = a.shape[axis]
    lowercut = int(proportiontocut * nobs)
    uppercut = nobs - lowercut
    if (lowercut >= uppercut):
        raise ValueError("Proportion too big.")

    atmp = np.partition(a, (lowercut, uppercut - 1), axis)

    sl = [slice(None)] * atmp.ndim
    sl[axis] = slice(lowercut, uppercut)
    return atmp[tuple(sl)]

```

## Response

Table of inputs and outputs for the function 'trimboth'

| **Inputs** | **proportiontocut** | **axis** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` | `0.2` | `None` | `[2, 3, 4]` |
| `a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]` | `0.4` | `0` | `[[20, 30, 40]]` |
| `a = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]` | `0.5` | `1` | `[[2], [4], [6], [8]]` |

Execution of the function:

1. The function takes three inputs:
    - a: an array.
    - proportiontocut: a float representing proportion that will be cut from both ends.
    - axis: integer, optional. Axis to be trimmed. Default is 0.
2. The function first converts the input array 'a' to numpy array a using the method `asarray()` in case it's not already a numpy array.
3. It checks if the size of the numpy array is zero. If it is, the function returns the input array itself.
4. If the axis is None, reshape the numpy array to a 1-D array and set axis to 0.
5. The number of observations is determined using the `shape[]` function.
6. The 'lowercut' variable is calculated as the integer part of the product of 'proportiontocut' and the number of observations.
7. The 'uppercut' variable is calculated as the difference of the number of observations and 'lowercut'.
8. If the 'lowercut' value is greater than or equal to 'uppercut', a ValueError is raised.
9. Using the `partition()` method, a copy of the input array is partitioned along the given 'axis', splitting the array into three sections:
    - A left partition containing 'lowercut' smallest elements.
    - A middle partition containing the remaining elements.
    - A right partition containing 'uppercut' largest elements.
10. A slice object, 'sl', is created of the same size as 'a' ndim.
11. One of the elements of the slice object 'sl' is updated by setting the value of the 'axis' parameter to the slice of the middle partition.
12. The resulting trimmed array is returned by indexing the partitioned array at 'sl'.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

For the first input of `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `proportiontocut = 0.2`, and `axis = None`:

1. The function sets the input array `a` as a NumPy array.
    ```
    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> a = np.asarray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    ```
2. The number of observations is determined using the `shape[]` function. Since the input array is not 2-D, the function reshapes the array to a 1-D array, and updates the `axis` variable to 0.
    ```
    a = np.asarray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) -> flatten
    axis = 0
    ```
3. Since the array is 1-D, the `shape[]` function returns the number of elements, which is 5.
4. The 'lowercut' variable is calculated as the integer part of the product of 0.2 and 5, which is 1.
5. The 'uppercut' variable is calculated as the difference of 5 and 1, which is 4.
6. Since the value of 'lowercut' is less than 'uppercut', the function proceeds with calculating the trimmed array.
7. Using the `partition()` method, the input array is partitioned such that the smallest element is in the left partition, the 2nd to 4th elements are in the middle partition, and the largest element is at the right.
    ```
    np.partition([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], (1, 3)) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> [2, 3, 4, 1, 5]
    ```
8. The slice object 'sl' is updated by setting the value of the 'axis' parameter to the slice of the middle partition, which is (1,4).
    ```
    sl[axis] = slice(1, 4) -> sl = [slice(1, 4)]
    ```
9. By indexing the partitioned array at 'sl', the trimmed array is returned.
    ```
    atmp[tuple(sl)] -> atmp[slice(1, 4)] -> [2, 3, 4]
    ```
The output is `[2, 3, 4]`.

For the second input of `a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]`, `proportiontocut = 0.4`, and `axis = 0`:

1. The function sets the input array `a` as a NumPy array.
    ```
    a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60] -> a = np.asarray([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])
    ```
2. The number of observations is determined using the `shape[]` function. The input array is already 1-D so the axis remains 0.
    ```
    a = np.asarray([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])
    axis = 0
    ```
3. The number of observations is 6.
4. The 'lowercut' variable is calculated as the integer part of the product of 0.4 and 6, which is 2.
5. The 'uppercut' variable is calculated as the difference of 6 and 2, which is 4.
6. Since the value of 'lowercut' is less than 'uppercut', the function proceeds with calculating the trimmed array.
7. Using the `partition()` method, the input array is partitioned such that the 2 smallest elements are in the left partition, the 3rd and 4th elements are in the middle partition, and the 2 largest elements are at the right.
    ```
    np.partition([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60], (2, 4)) = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60] -> [20, 10, 30, 40, 50, 60]
    ```
8. The slice object 'sl' is updated by setting the value of the 'axis' parameter to the slice of the middle partition, which is (1, 3).
    ```
    sl[axis] = slice(1, 3) -> sl = [slice(None, None, None), slice(1, 3)]
    ```
9. By indexing the partitioned array at 'sl', the trimmed array is returned.
    ```
    atmp[tuple(sl)] -> atmp[:, 1:3] -> [[20, 30, 40]]
    ```
The output is `[[20, 30, 40]]`.

For the third input of `a = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]`, `proportiontocut = 0.5`, and `axis = 1`:

1. The function sets the input array `a` as a NumPy array.
    ```
    a = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]] -> a = np.asarray([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])
    ```
2. The number of observations is determined using the `shape[]` function. The input array is 2-D so axis is 1.
    ```
    a = np.asarray([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])
    axis = 1
    ```
3. The number of observations is 4.
4. The 'lowercut' variable is calculated as the integer part of the product of 0.5 and 4, which is 2.
5. The 'uppercut' variable is calculated as the difference of 4 and 2, which is also 2.
6. Since the value of 'lowercut' is equal to 'uppercut', a ValueError is raised.
    ```
    raise ValueError("Proportion too big.")
    ```
The output is `ValueError: Proportion too big.`.

## Observation
- The generated combination of input-output pairs is correct except for the last one. The expected output for last input is ValueError.
- The reasoning given for each combination is correct.

## Prompt

**Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.**

## Response

The function produced above is already efficient and runnable. However, we can make some minor changes for better readability and consistency:

1. Include all necessary imports inside the function.

2. Rename the variables to more meaningful names.

3. Remove unnecessary checks.

4. Use '_' as the default value for variables that are not passed in.

Here's the refactored code: 

```
def trim_both_ends(a, proportion_to_cut, axis=0):
    """
    Trim values from both ends of a data distribution.

    Parameters:
    a: numpy.ndarray
        Input array.
    proportion_to_cut: float
        Proportion of data points to be trimmed at both ends of distribution.
    axis: int, optional
        Axis along which the operation is to be performed. Defaults to 0.

    Return:
    numpy.ndarray
        Trimmed array.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If the proportion_to_cut argument is too big.
    """

    import numpy as np

    n_elements = a.shape[axis]
    lower_cutoff = int(proportion_to_cut * n_elements)
    upper_cutoff = n_elements - lower_cutoff

        raise ValueError("Proportion too big.")

    sorted_array = np.partition(a, (lower_cutoff, upper_cutoff - 1), axis)

    slice_idx = [slice(None)] * sorted_array.ndim 
    slice_idx[axis] = slice(lower_cutoff, upper_cutoff)
    
    return sorted_array[tuple(slice_idx)]

## Observation
- The generated code is semantically equivalent to the original code.
- The code was refactored by removing some non-required part and added comments to give better idea about the code.
