# Task 1: Reasoning

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```

def zscore(a, axis=0, ddof=0, nan_policy='propagate'):
    return zmap(a, a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof, nan_policy=nan_policy)

```

## Response

Table:

| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| a | The array for which the z-score is calculated. |
| axis | The axis along which the z-score is calculated. Default value is 0. |
| ddof | Degrees of freedom. Default value is 0. |
| nan_policy | Defines the action that is taken if NaN values are present in the input data. Default value is 'propagate'. |

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| zscore(a) | Returns the z-score of the elements in array 'a' along the specified axis. |

Explanation:

- The function 'zscore' returns the z-score of the elements in the input array 'a' along the specified axis.
- The parameter 'axis' is optional and its default value is 0, which means that the z-scores are calculated along the first dimension of the input array. If some other value is passed to 'axis', then the calculation is performed along that particular axis.
- The parameter 'ddof' represents degrees of freedom and its default value is 0. If some other value is passed to 'ddof', then the calculation is performed based on the provided value.
- The parameter 'nan_policy' defines the action that is taken if NaN values are encountered in the input data. If the value of 'nan_policy' is set to 'propagate', the function propagates NaNs, which means that the output for that element is also NaN. If the value of 'nan_policy' is set to 'raise', then an error is raised.

Example:
Suppose 'a' is the input array with values `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

Case 1: `zscore(a)`
- The function is called without passing values for the optional parameters i.e. 'axis', 'ddof', and 'nan_policy'. 
- The z-scores are calculated along the first dimension of the input array.
- The output will be: `[-1.34164079,-0.4472136, 0.4472136, 1.34164079]`.

Case 2: `zscore(a, axis=1)`
- The z-scores will be calculated along the second dimension of the input array.
- Since 'a' is a one-dimensional array, the output will be the same as `zscore(a)`.

Case 3: `zscore(a, ddof=1, nan_policy='raise')`
- The z-scores are calculated along the first dimension of the input array with degrees of freedom as 1.
- Since there are no NaN values in the input, no error will be raised.
- The output will be: `[-1.161895, -0.3872983, 0.3872983, 1.161895]`.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. Calculation and Reasoning for `zscore(a)`:
 
- Input: `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- By default, `axis=0`, `ddof=0`, and `nan_policy='propagate'`.
- The formula for calculating the z-score is: `(x - mean) / std_dev`, where `x` is the data point, `mean` is the mean of the data, and `std_dev` is the standard deviation of the data.
- Calculating the mean of 'a': `(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 2.5`.
- Calculating the standard deviation of 'a': $\sqrt{\dfrac{(1-2.5)^2 + (2-2.5)^2 + (3-2.5)^2 + (4-2.5)^2}{4}} = 1.118034`.
- Calculating the z-scores using the formula: `[-1.34164079, -0.4472136, 0.4472136, 1.34164079]`.
- The output is the calculated z-scores for the input data.

2. Calculation and Reasoning for `zscore(a, axis=1)`:

- Input: `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `axis=1`.
- The input array 'a' is one-dimensional, so the calculation is the same as that of `zscore(a)`.
- The output is the calculated z-scores for the input data.


3. Calculation and Reasoning for `zscore(a, ddof=1, nan_policy='raise')`:

- Input: `a=[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `ddof=1`, and `nan_policy='raise'`.
- The formula for calculating the z-score is: `(x - mean) / std_dev`, where `x` is the data point, `mean` is the mean of the data, and `std_dev` is the standard deviation of the data.
- Calculating the mean of 'a': `(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 2.5`.
- Calculating the standard deviation of 'a': $\sqrt{\dfrac{(1-2.5)^2 + (2-2.5)^2 + (3-2.5)^2 + (4-2.5)^2}{3}} = 1.291`.
- Calculating the z-scores using the formula: `[-1.161895, -0.3872983, 0.3872983, 1.161895]`.
- Since the value of the parameter `nan_policy` is 'raise', and there are no NaN values in the input array, no exception will be raised.
- The output is the calculated z-scores for the input data, with degrees of freedom as 1.

# Task 2: Generate Tests

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write unit test for testing the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Import all the required packages, Mock all the functions and classes required by the method.**

**code:**

```

def zscore(a, axis=0, ddof=0, nan_policy='propagate'):
    return zmap(a, a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof, nan_policy=nan_policy)

```

## Response

To write the unit test for the given function we need to import the necessary packages and Mock the required functions and classes.

```python
import numpy as np
import unittest
from unittest.mock import Mock
from my_module import zscore

def test_zscore():
    # Create a mock input and output values
    a = [1,2,3,4,5]
    expected_output = [-1.26491106, -0.63245553, 0. , 0.63245553, 1.26491106]
    
    # Mock zmap function
    zmap = Mock()
    zmap.return_value = expected_output
    
    # Call the function with mock inputs
    output = zscore(a, axis=0, ddof=0, nan_policy='propagate')
    
    # Assert the output with expected output
    np.testing.assert_allclose(output, expected_output)
```

In this test function, we first create a mock input and expected output values. Then we create a Mock object `zmap` to mock the `zmap` function called inside the function. We set the `return_value` of the `zmap` mock object to our expected output. Lastly, we call the `zscore` function with the mock inputs and assert the output with the expected output using `np.testing.assert_allclose()` function.

## Prompt

**Refactor the unit test produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.**

## Response

Sure, Here is the refactored test function:

```python
import numpy as np
import unittest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

def test_zscore():
    # Create a mock input and output values
    a = [1,2,3,4,5]
    expected_output = [-1.26491106, -0.63245553, 0. , 0.63245553, 1.26491106]

    with patch('my_module.zmap') as mock_zmap:
      # Mock zmap function
      mock_zmap.return_value = expected_output

      # Call the function with mock inputs
      output = zscore(a, axis=0, ddof=0, nan_policy='propagate')

      # Assert the output with expected output
      np.testing.assert_allclose(output, expected_output)
```

In this refactored test function, we use the `with patch` context manager to mock the `zmap` function called inside the `zscore` function. This allows us to isolate the function being tested and ensure that it only depends on the expected inputs and mocked output. We set the `return_value` of the `mock_zmap` to our expected output. Finally, we call the `zscore` function with the mock inputs and assert the output with the expected output using `np.testing.assert_allclose()` function.

# Task 3: Generate Semantically Equivalent Method

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Method signature should remain identical, Return type of the function should also remain identical, Add comments to the method when required, Add <COMMENTS> to the method.**

**code:**

```

def zscore(a, axis=0, ddof=0, nan_policy='propagate'):
    return zmap(a, a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof, nan_policy=nan_policy)

```

## Response

```
# This function computes the z-score of a given array along a specified axis
# It takes in an array 'a', axis along which to compute the z-score, ddof value and a nan policy
# The default value for 'axis' is 0, 'ddof' is 0 and 'nan_policy' is 'propagate'
# It returns the z-score of the input 'a' using the zmap method
def zscore(a, axis=0, ddof=0, nan_policy='propagate'):

    # The resulting array of z-scores is returned
    return zmap(a, a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof, nan_policy=nan_policy)
``` 

# Modified function

    return zmap(a, a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof, nan_policy=nan_policy)
```

## Prompt

**Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.**

## Response

Sure, here's the refactored function that is runnable and more efficient:

```
import numpy as np

def zscore(a, axis=0, ddof=0, nan_policy='propagate'):
    """
    This function computes the z-score of a given array along a specified axis.
    
    :param a: input array
    :param axis: axis along which to compute the z-score (default = 0)
    :param ddof: delta degrees of freedom. The divisor used in calculations is N - ddof,
                 where N represents the number of non-NaN elements. (default = 0)
    :param nan_policy: Whether or not to propagate NaNs (default = 'propagate')
    
    :return: z-score of the input array using the zmap method
    """
    zscore = (a - np.nanmean(a, axis=axis)) / np.nanstd(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof)
    return zscore
```

I used NumPy's built-in `nanmean` and `nanstd` functions to compute the mean and standard deviation along the specified axis, which is more efficient and handles NaN values correctly. Then, I simply subtracted the mean and divided by the standard deviation to compute the z-score.
