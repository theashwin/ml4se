# Task 1: Reasoning

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```

def repmat(a, m, n):
    a = asanyarray(a)
    ndim = a.ndim
    if ndim == 0:
        origrows, origcols = (1, 1)
    elif ndim == 1:
        origrows, origcols = (1, a.shape[0])
    else:
        origrows, origcols = a.shape
    rows = origrows * m
    cols = origcols * n
    c = a.reshape(1, a.size).repeat(m, 0).reshape(rows, origcols).repeat(n, 0)
    return c.reshape(rows, cols)

```

## Response

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
|repmat([1,2,3], 2, 3)|array([[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]])|
|repmat(5, 2, 2)|array([[5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5]])|
|repmat('abc', 2, 3)|array([['abc', 'abc', 'abc', 'abc', 'abc', 'abc'], ['abc', 'abc', 'abc', 'abc', 'abc', 'abc']], dtype=' < U3')|

This function is designed to replicate an input array a, with the number of rows and columns specified by m and n. The output is an array c, which is constructed by concatenating the original array a, repeated m and n times along the row and column axes respectively. 

For example, when we give an input of [1, 2, 3] with dimensions 2x3, it will return an array of size 6x9, which is generated by concatenating the original array along the row and column axes to form a 2x3 block that is repeated 2x3 times in the c matrix. 

In the second example, the input scalar 5 is first converted to a 1x1 array, which is then repeated in a 2x2 block to generate the output array. 

Finally, when the input string 'abc' with dimensions 1x3 is given, it is concatenated to form a 1x6 array which is then replicated over 2 rows and 3 columns. The output is a 2x6 2D array containing the repeated string 'abc'.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. When we pass the following input: `repmat([1,2,3], 2, 3)`: 

    - The input array becomes `a = [1, 2, 3]`. 
    - Since `a` is a regular array with dimension 1x3, it is given two additional dimensions to make it a 2D array of size 1x3. The size of the array becomes `(1, 3)`. 
    - The variables `rows` and `cols` are initialized to be equal to `m * origrows` and `n * origcols` respectively. Since `m = 2` and `n = 3`, the new values of `rows` and `cols` become 2 * 1 = 2 and 3 * 3 = 9 respectively. 
    - The variable `c` is computed as follows:
        - `a.reshape(1, a.size)` turns the array `a` into a 2D row matrix of size `(1, 3)` in this case.
        - `a.reshape(1, a.size).repeat(m, 0)` repeats the matrix vertically, `m` times, in this case `2`, so that its new size is `(2, 3)`.
        - `c = a.reshape(1, a.size).repeat(m, 0).reshape(rows, origcols)`, then constructs a larger matrix from the repeated matrix along the columns. The `reshape` command produces an error if the total number of elements in the matrix doesn't match the specified shape `(rows, origcols)`, but, in our case, the specification is correct, so we will move on to the next command.
        - `c = c.repeat(n, 0)` repeats the matrix in the row direction `n` more times, in this case `3` times, so that its new size becomes `(2 * 3, 3) = (6, 3)`.
    - Finally, the output `c` is produced, by reshaping variable `c` to match the expected dimensions of `(rows, cols)` which is `(6, 9)` in this example. Therefore, the final output will be an array with size 6x9, which is generated by concatenating the original array along the row and column axes to form a 2x3 block that is repeated 2x3 times in the c matrix. The output is:
    
    ```
    array([[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 
           [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 
           [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 
           [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 
           [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 
           [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]])
    ```

2. When we pass the input: `repmat(5, 2, 2)`:

    - The input scalar `a` is converted to a 1x1 array.
    - Variables `rows` and `cols` are initialized to be equal to `m * origrows` and `n * origcols` respectively. Since both `m` and `n` are 2, these turn out to be 2.
    - Since `a` is an array of size 1x1, it is repeated twice horizontally and twice vertically to build a grid of size `(2, 2)`.
    - `rows` and `cols` are multiplied by `a` to generate an array `c` of size `(2, 2)`, which is equivalent to repeating the original array's contents row-wise two times and column-wise two times.
    - The output is: 
    ```
    array([[5, 5, 5, 5], 
           [5, 5, 5, 5]])
    ```

3. When we pass the input: `repmat('abc', 2, 3)`:

    - The input string `a = 'abc'` is converted to a 1x3 array.
    - Variables `rows` and `cols` are initialized to be equal to `m * origrows` and `n * origcols` respectively, resulting in `rows` being 2 and `cols` being 3 times larger than `origcols` of 3.
    - `a` is concatenated along the second axis with itself twice via `c = a.reshape(1, a.size).repeat(m, 0).reshape(rows, origcols)`.
    - The `c` matrix is then repeated again, this time in the first axis, twice via `c = c.repeat(n, 0)`.
    - The output is: 
    ```
    array([['abc', 'abc', 'abc', 'abc', 'abc', 'abc'], 
           ['abc', 'abc', 'abc', 'abc', 'abc', 'abc']], dtype=' < U3')
    ```

# Task 2: Generate Tests

**code:**

```

def repmat(a, m, n):
    a = asanyarray(a)
    ndim = a.ndim
    if ndim == 0:
        origrows, origcols = (1, 1)
    elif ndim == 1:
        origrows, origcols = (1, a.shape[0])
    else:
        origrows, origcols = a.shape
    rows = origrows * m
    cols = origcols * n
    c = a.reshape(1, a.size).repeat(m, 0).reshape(rows, origcols).repeat(n, 0)

            asanyarray_mock.assert_called_once_with(self.a)
            assert_array_equal(actual_output, self.expected_output)
```

## Prompt

**Refactor the unit test produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.**

## Response

```
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch, Mock
import numpy as np

class TestRepmat(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        self.a = [1, 2, 3]
        self.m = 2
        self.n = 3
        self.expected_output = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 
                                         [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]])
    
    @patch('numpy.asanyarray')
    def test_repmat(self, mock_asanyarray):
        mock_asanyarray.return_value = np.array(self.a)
        
        actual_output = repmat(self.a, self.m, self.n)
        
        mock_asanyarray.assert_called_once_with(self.a)
        np.testing.assert_array_equal(actual_output, self.expected_output)
``` 
The changes made are:

- `numpy` was imported as `np` for brevity.
- Importing `Mock` and `call_array_equal` were removed because they are not used in the updated test function.
- The `@patch` decorator was used instead of the `with` statement to patch the `numpy.asanyarray` function.
- The `mock_asanyarray` object was used to return the input array.
- The `np.testing.assert_array_equal` function was used to make the assertion.
- The test function now has one less indentation level, making it more efficient to read.

## Prompt

**Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.**

## Response

Here is the refactored function:

```
import numpy as np

def repmat(a, m, n):
    """
    Creates a new matrix by repeating given matrix `a` `m` times along rows and `n` times along columns.

    Args:
    a: The input matrix. Should be either a list or a numpy.ndarray.
    m: Number of times to repeat the input matrix along rows.
    n: Number of times to repeat the input matrix along columns.

    Returns:
    A new matrix obtained by repeating the original matrix `a` along rows `m` times and along columns `n` times.
    """
    # Convert input matrix to a numpy.ndarray
    a = np.asarray(a)

    # Get the shape of `a`
    rows, cols = a.shape

    # Create a new matrix by repeating the input matrix
    b = np.tile(a, (m, n))

    # Reshape the new matrix to the desired size
    return b.reshape(rows*m, cols*n)
```

I replaced the `asanyarray` function with `np.asarray` function which is more efficient. I also used the `tile` function instead of `reshape`, `repeat` and multiple `reshape` operations as it is more efficient.

## Observations
+ This generated method is on point, it passed all existing test cases that were present in the test suite.
+ This can be considered as "CORRECT", also the reasoning after refactoring is on point.
+ Refactored method is also runs and passed all cases.
