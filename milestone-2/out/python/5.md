# Task 1: Reasoning

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```

from numpy import asarray, copy, dot, einsum, empty, multiply


def dotd(A, B, out=None):
   
    A = asarray(A, float)
    B = asarray(B, float)
    if A.ndim == 1 and B.ndim == 1:
        if out is None:
            return dot(A, B)
        return dot(A, B, out)
    if out is None:
        out = empty((A.shape[0],), float)
    return einsum("ij,ji->i", A, B, out=out)

```

## Response

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
|A = [[2, 3], [4, 5]], B = [[6, 7], [8, 9]] | array([ 33.,  76.]) |
|A = [1, 2, 3], B = [4, 5, 6] | 32 |
|A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], B = [5, 6] | ValueError: invalid output shape|

Execution:
- The function takes two inputs A and B and an optional output array 'out'.
- It converts the input arrays A and B into an array of float type using numpy.as_array() method.
- Then it checks if both A and B are 1-D arrays. If true and out parameter is None, it performs a simple dot product using numpy.dot() method with A and B as arguments and returns the result.
- If out parameter is not None, it performs the same dot product as before but the result is stored in the output array 'out'.
- If A and B are not 1-D arrays, and out parameter is None, then it creates an empty array of shape A.shape[0] and data type float using numpy.empty() method. 
- Finally, it performs an einstein summation on A and B using numpy.einsum() method with argument "ij,ji->i", which calculates the dot product along the second axis of A and B and stores it in the output array 'out'.
- It returns the output array 'out' as the result of the function.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. Input: 
A = [[2, 3], [4, 5]], B = [[6, 7], [8, 9]]
Output: array([ 33.,  76.])

Execution:
- The function takes input arrays A and B, both of which are two-dimensional arrays.
- Since out parameter is None in this case, it creates an empty array of shape A.shape[0] = 2 and data type float using numpy.empty() method.
- Now it calculates the dot product along the second axis of A and B using numpy.einsum() method with argument "ij,ji->i". When we expand the einsum expression, we get dot(A[0], B[0]) and dot(A[1], B[1]) as the elements of the resulting array. Thus, we get [2*6+3*8, 4*7+5*9] which is [33, 76].
- Finally, the output array 'out' is returned as the result of the function.

2. Input:
A = [1, 2, 3], B = [4, 5, 6]
Output: 32

Execution:
- The function takes input arrays A and B, both of which are one-dimensional arrays.
- Since out parameter is None in this case, it performs a simple dot product using numpy.dot() method with A and B as arguments. When we expand the dot product expression, we get 1*4+2*5+3*6 which is 32.
- Finally, the dot product output 32 is returned as the result of the function.

3. Input:
A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], B = [5, 6]
Output: ValueError: invalid output shape

Execution:
- The function takes input arrays A and B, where A is a two-dimensional array and B is a one-dimensional array.
- Since out parameter is None in this case, it creates an empty array of shape A.shape[0] = 2 and data type float using numpy.empty() method.
- Now it tries to calculate the dot product along the second axis of A and B using numpy.einsum() method with argument "ij,ji->i". But since the shapes of A and B are not compatible for dot product calculation, it raises a ValueError with message 'invalid output shape'. This error occurred because B has no second axis to perform the dot product along with.
- The function returns the error as the result of the function.

## Observations
+ The generated edge cases and the calculations are on point as the math is easy.
+ This response can be termed as "CORRECT"

# Task 2: Generate Tests

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write unit test for testing the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Import all the required packages, Mock all the functions and classes required by the method.**

**code:**

```

from numpy import asarray, copy, dot, einsum, empty, multiply


def dotd(A, B, out=None):
   
    A = asarray(A, float)
    B = asarray(B, float)
    if A.ndim == 1 and B.ndim == 1:
        if out is None:
            return dot(A, B)
        return dot(A, B, out)
    if out is None:
        out = empty((A.shape[0],), float)
    return einsum("ij,ji->i", A, B, out=out)

```

## Response

Here is the unit test for the given code:

```
import unittest
from unittest import mock
from numpy.testing import assert_almost_equal
import numpy as np

class TestDotd(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_dotd(self):
        # Test case 1
        A = np.array([1, 2, 3])
        B = np.array([4, 5, 6])
        expected_output = 32
        mock_einsum = mock.Mock(return_value=np.array([32]))
        with mock.patch('numpy.einsum', mock_einsum):
            output = dotd(A, B)
            assert_almost_equal(output, expected_output)
            mock_einsum.assert_called_once_with("ij,ji->i", A, B, out=None)

        # Test case 2
        A = np.array([1, 2, 3])
        B = np.array([4, 5, 6])
        expected_output = np.array([32])
        out = np.array([0, 0, 0])
        mock_einsum = mock.Mock(return_value=np.array([32]))
        with mock.patch('numpy.einsum', mock_einsum):
            output = dotd(A, B, out=out)
            assert_almost_equal(output, expected_output)
            mock_einsum.assert_called_once_with("ij,ji->i", A, B, out=out)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Explanation:
* First, we import the required packages and classes: numpy, unittest, mock, and assert_almost_equal from numpy.testing.
* We define a class TestDotd, which extends unittest.TestCase.
* We define a test_dotd method, which will test the dotd function. 
    * First, we define the input variables and the expected output for two test cases: test case 1 tests the basic functionality of the function, while test case 2 tests the output parameter.
    * Then, we create a mock of the numpy.einsum function using the `mock.patch` decorator. Inside the with statement, we call the dotd function with the given inputs and the out parameter if needed. 
        * We check if the output matches the expected output using `assert_almost_equal`. 
        * We also check if the mocked function was called with the correct arguments using `mock_einsum.assert_called_once_with`.
* Finally, we run the unit test using unittest.main().

## Prompt

**Refactor the unit test produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.**

## Response

Here is the refactored version of the unit test:

```
import unittest
from unittest import mock
from numpy.testing import assert_almost_equal
import numpy as np

class TestDotd(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        A = np.array([1, 2, 3])
        B = np.array([4, 5, 6])
        self.test_cases = [
            {"A": A, "B": B, "out": None, "expected_output": 32, "msg": "should return dot product"},
            {"A": A, "B": B, "out": np.array([0, 0, 0]), "expected_output": np.array([32]), "msg": "should return dot product with output parameter"}
        ]
        
    @mock.patch('numpy.einsum')
    def test_dotd(self, mock_einsum):
        for test_case in self.test_cases:
            A = test_case["A"]
            B = test_case["B"]
            out = test_case["out"]
            expected_output = test_case["expected_output"]
            msg = test_case["msg"]

            mock_einsum.return_value = expected_output
            output = dotd(A, B, out=out)

            mock_einsum.assert_called_once_with("ij,ji->i", A, B, out=out)
            assert_almost_equal(output, expected_output, err_msg=msg)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Explanation:
* We define our test cases in the setUp method instead of defining them inside the test method. This makes it easier to add or remove test cases.
* We use a patch decorator to mock the einsum function, which allows us to check if the function was called with the correct arguments and return the expected output.
* We write a for loop to iterate through each test case, rather than writing separate tests for each test case. We extract the inputs and outputs for each test case from the test case dictionary.
* We use the error message parameter in the assert_almost_equal function to provide a more meaningful error message when the test fails.
* Finally, we run the unit test using unittest.main(). This allows the script to be run as a standalone program.

## Observations
+ There were some syntactic mistakes in the generated function, after fixing those errors the functions ran successfully.
+ The calculation is also on point as [1, 2, 3] dot [4, 5, 6] is in fact 32 as predicted.
+ Baring syntactic goof ups the answer can be termed as "CORRECT"
