# Reasoning

For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Step by step. Be as specific as possible. Assume variable's contents as required.

| Inputs         | Outputs        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| A = [1,2,3], B = [4,5,6], out = None    | 32.0 |
| A = [[1,2],[3,4]], B = [5,6], out = [0,0] | [17.0, 39.0] |
|A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], B = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], out = None | [[ 1., 2.], [ 3., 4.]] |

When the input parameters A, B, and out are given to the function, the following sequence of steps are executed:

1- The function converts A and B into an array in float format using the numpy asarray() function.

2- The function checks if both A and B are one-dimensional arrays. If they are, it returns the dot product of A and B.

3- If both A and B are higher-dimensional arrays, the function creates an empty array with the same number of rows as A, and calculates the matrix product of A and B using the einsum() function. The matrix product is then entered into the empty array and returned as the final output.

4- If the out parameter is not None, the function returns the output directly instead of assigning it to an empty array.

Show calculations for each of the three input-output pairs. Step by step. 

1- Input A = [1,2,3], B = [4,5,6], out = None:

- A and B are already one-dimensional arrays of equal length, the function calculates the dot product using the dot() function and returns the result, which is 32.0.

2- Input A = [[1,2],[3,4]], B = [5,6], out = [0,0]:

- A is a two-dimensional array with 2 rows and 2 columns. B is a one-dimensional array with 2 elements. The function proceeds to create an empty one-dimensional array of length 2 to store the result.

- The function calculates the dot product between A and B using the einsum() function with specification "ij,ji->i". The i in front of the arrow indicates that the result should be a one-dimensional array. The specification "ij,ji" indicates that the dot product should be taken between the last axis of A (axis 1) and the first axis of B (axis 0).

- The resulting dot product is [17., 39.], which is entered into the empty array out. The function returns out as the final output [17.0, 39.0].

3- Input A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], B = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], out = None:

- A and B are both two-dimensional arrays. The function proceeds to create an empty two-dimensional array of shape (2,2) to store the result.

- The function calculates the matrix product between A and B using the einsum() function with specification "ij,jk->ik". The i and j before the arrow indicate that the result should be a two-dimensional array. The specification "ij,jk" indicates that the matrix product should be taken between the last axis of A (axis 1) and the first axis of B (axis 0).

- The resulting matrix product is [[1., 2.], [3., 4.]], which is the final output of the function.

# Tests

---

For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write unit test for testing the function. Import all the required packages and mock all the functions and classes required by the method.

Refactor the unit test produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

To write the test case for the function, we need to follow these steps:

1. Import the required packages and modules (unittest, mock, numpy)
2. Import the function `dotd` from the source file.
3. Create a test class `TestDotd` that extends unittest.TestCase.
4. Create a test method `test_dot_product` to test the behavior of the `dotd` function.
5. Mock the required function and classes to run the test efficiently.

Refactored Test cases with the required imports and mock calls are listed below : 

```python
from unittest import TestCase, mock
import numpy as np
from numpy.testing import assert_array_almost_equal

from source_file import dotd


class TestDotd(TestCase):
    @mock.patch('source_file.asarray')
    @mock.patch('source_file.dot')
    def test_dot_product_dim1(self, mock_dot, mock_asarray):
        # Setup mock behaviour
        A = np.array([1, 2, 3])
        B = np.array([4, 5, 6])
        mock_asarray.side_effect = lambda a, _: a
        mock_dot.return_value = 32
        
        # Execute function with mocked dependencies.
        res = dotd(A,B)

        # Test expected behavior.
        mock_asarray.assert_called_once_with(A, float)
        mock_dot.assert_called_once_with(A, B)
        self.assertEqual(res, 32)

    @mock.patch('source_file.asarray')
    @mock.patch('source_file.einsum')
    def test_dot_product_dim2(self, mock_einsum, mock_asarray):
        # Setup mock behaviour
        A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
        B = np.array([[2, 4], [5, 6]])
        out = np.array([1, 0, 0], dtype=float)
        expected_res = np.array([14, 34, 54])
        mock_asarray.side_effect = lambda a, _: a
        mock_einsum.return_value = expected_res

        # Execute function with mocked dependencies.
        res = dotd(A, B, out=out)

        # Test expected behavior.
        mock_asarray.assert_called_once_with(A, float)
        mock_asarray.assert_called_once_with(B, float)
        mock_einsum.assert_called_once_with('ij,ji->i', A, B, out=out)
        assert_array_almost_equal(res, expected_res)
```

# Refactoring

For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent code. Keep the method signature as it is just modify the contents of the function.

Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.

The function with comments is:

```python
from numpy import asarray, copy, dot, einsum, empty, multiply

def dotd(A, B, out=None):
    """
    Calculate the dot product between two vectors or matrices.

    Parameters:
    A (array_like): First argument of the dot product.
    B (array_like): Second argument of the dot product.
    out (ndarray, optional): output array where the result is stored. 
        Default is None, which causes the function to allocate a new array.

    Returns:
    ndarray: Returns the dot product of A and B.

    """
   
    A = asarray(A, float)  # Convert A to a float array.
    B = asarray(B, float)  # Convert B to a float array.
    
    if A.ndim == 1 and B.ndim == 1:
        # If A and B are one-dimensional arrays.
        if out is None:
            # If out is not provided, calculate and return the dot product of A and B.
            return dot(A, B)
