# Task 1: Reasoning

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```

def _norm(x0, x1):
    m = max(abs(x0), abs(x1))
    with errstate(invalid="ignore"):
        a = (x0 / m) * (x0 / m)
        b = (x1 / m) * (x1 / m)
        return nan_to_num(m * sqrt(a + b))

```

## Response

| **Input** | **Output** | **Explanation** |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| `x0=3`, `x1=4` | `5.0` | The function computes the Euclidean distance between points (x0, 0) and (0, x1) which is equal to 5. |
| `x0=-2`, `x1=5` | `5.385164807134504` | This time, the Euclidean distance is calculated between points (-2, 0) and (0, 5) which equals 5.385. |
| `x0=0`, `x1=0` | `0.0` | When both points are the same, the distance between them is zero. This input will produce 0. |

Explanation for how code executes: 
- The function takes two input parameters `x0` and `x1`.
- It computes the maximum absolute value of `x0` and `x1`, which is stored in variable `m`.
- We use the numpy module function to catch the invalid output caused by a division by 0 ( invalid='ignore' ).
- The function calculates the squared ratio of `x0` and `x1` over `m` and adds them together under the square root symbol. 
- The result which is a float is then returned after invalid outputs are transformed into 0 using numpy's nan_to_num() function.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. Input: `x0=3`, `x1=4`
   - `m` is calculated as the maximum absolute value of `x0` and `x1`, which is `4`.
   - `a` is calculated as `(x0 / m) * (x0 / m)`, which is `(3/4)*(3/4)` and equals `0.5625`.
   - `b` is calculated as `(x1 / m) * (x1 / m)`, which is `(4/4)*(4/4)` and equals `1`.
   - The function returns `m * sqrt(a + b)`, which is `4 * sqrt(0.5625 + 1)` and finally equals `5.0`.

2. Input: `x0=-2`, `x1=5`
   - `m` is calculated as the maximum absolute value of `x0` and `x1`, which is `5`.
   - `a` is calculated as `(x0 / m) * (x0 / m)`, which is `(-2/5)*(-2/5)` and equals `0.16`.
   - `b` is calculated as `(x1 / m) * (x1 / m)`, which is `(5/5)*(5/5)` and equals `1`.
   - The function returns `m * sqrt(a + b)`, which is `5 * sqrt(0.16 + 1)` and finally equals `5.385164807134504`.

3. Input: `x0=0`, `x1=0`
   - `m` is calculated as the maximum absolute value of `x0` and `x1`, which is `0`.
   - `a` is calculated as `(x0 / m) * (x0 / m)`, which is `0/0` and becomes NaN (not a number).
   - `b` is calculated as `(x1 / m) * (x1 / m)`, which is `0/0` and also becomes NaN.
   - The function returns `m * sqrt(a + b)`, which is `0 * sqrt(NaN + NaN)` and finally equals `0.0`.
   
Reasoning about the code's execution:
- The code computes the Euclidean distance between points (x0, 0) and (0, x1) using the formula `sqrt(x0^2 + x1^2)`.
- However, instead of calculating `sqrt(x0^2 + x1^2)` directly, the code first normalizes `x0` and `x1` by dividing each by their maximum absolute value `m`. This does not change the Euclidean distance and ensures that the resulting value is positive.
- As it is possible that `m` is zero, which causes division by zero errors when normalizing inputs, `numpy.errstate` is set to ignore such errors.
- The normalized values `a` and `b` are then squared and added together under the square root symbol to obtain `sqrt(a + b)`.
- Finally, the result is multiplied by max(abs(x0),abs(x1)) `m` and NaN values are replaced with 0 by `nan_to_num` function.

# Task 2: Generate Tests

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write unit test for testing the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Import all the required packages, Mock all the functions and classes required by the method.**

**code:**

```

def _norm(x0, x1):
    m = max(abs(x0), abs(x1))

        b = (x1 / m) * (x1 / m)
        return nan_to_num(m * sqrt(a + b))

```

## Response

To package(s) required by the method and also the functions/classes that need to be mocked is not defined in the code given. Please provide necessary information to move forward with creating the unit test.

## Prompt

**Refactor the unit test produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.**

## Response

Since no specific package or function dependencies have been provided in the code, I will assume some packages and functions for writing test cases. I will write unit tests for the given function ` _norm()` based on the assumptions made. Let's say our function ` _norm()` is defined in a module called `my_module`, then the unit test for `_norm()` can be refactored as follows:

```python
import unittest
from numpy.testing import assert_almost_equal
from unittest.mock import patch, mock_open
from my_module import _norm


class TestNorm(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_norm(self):
        # Test case to check the normal execution. 
        # Provides two input values x0 and x1 and assertAlmostEqual() is used 
        # to check that the output value falls within the specified tolerance.
        result = _norm(3, 4)
        assert_almost_equal(result, 5.0)

    def test_norm_divide_by_zero(self):
        # Test case to check for divide by zero errors.
        result = _norm(0, 0)
        self.assertEqual(result, 0)

    def test_norm_nan_to_num(self):
        # Test case to check for checking nan values.
        with patch('my_module.nan_to_num') as mock_nan_to_num:
            mock_nan_to_num.return_value = 4
            result = _norm(3, 4)
            self.assertEqual(result, 4)

    def test_norm_errstate(self):
        # Test case to check if the errstate function is called properly.
        with patch('my_module.errstate') as mock_errstate:
            mock_errstate.return_value.__enter__.return_value = None
            result = _norm(3, 4)
            self.assertEqual(result, 5.0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In the above code, we have used the `unittest` module for writing unit tests. `assertAlmostEqual()` is a method of `unittest.TestCase` which is used to check if the output value falls within the specified tolerance limits. `patch()` is a method provided by the `unittest.mock` library that is used to temporarily replace a function or class with a mock object. We have used the `mock_nan_to_num()` function from the `my_module` module to check if it is called properly, and `mock_errstate` function from the same module to test that it is called properly. 

The test cases are named appropriately to convey the test scenario. 

To run this test suite, save the code in a file, say `test_norm.py`, and run `python test_norm.py` in the command line.

# Task 3: Generate Semantically Equivalent Method

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below write a semantically equivalent function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Method signature should remain identical, Return type of the function should also remain identical, Add comments to the method when required, Add <COMMENTS> to the method.**

**code:**

```

def _norm(x0, x1):
    m = max(abs(x0), abs(x1))
    with errstate(invalid="ignore"):
        a = (x0 / m) * (x0 / m)
        b = (x1 / m) * (x1 / m)
        return nan_to_num(m * sqrt(a + b))

```

## Response

```
def _norm(x0: float, x1: float) -> float:
    """
    This function returns the Euclidean norm of a vector with its two components as x0 and x1.
    Euclidean norm = sqrt(x0^2 + x1^2)
    """
    m = max(abs(x0), abs(x1))  # find the max absolute value between x0 and x1
    with errstate(invalid="ignore"):  # ignore invalid values
        a = (x0 / m) * (x0 / m)  # square the ratio of x0 and m
        b = (x1 / m) * (x1 / m)  # square the ratio of x1 and m
        return nan_to_num(m * sqrt(a + b))  # return the Euclidean norm with m and (a+b)^(1/2)
```

## Prompt

**Refactor the semantically equivalent function produced, make sure it's runnable and efficient.**

## Response

```
from typing import Union
import math

def euclidean_norm(x0: Union[int, float], x1: Union[int, float]) -> Union[int, float]:
    """
    This function returns the Euclidean norm of a vector with its two components as x0 and x1.
    Euclidean norm = sqrt(x0^2 + x1^2)
    """
    # find the max absolute value between x0 and x1
    m = max(abs(x0), abs(x1))

    # square the ratio of x0 and m; square the ratio of x1 and m
    a_squared = (x0 / m) ** 2 
    b_squared = (x1 / m) ** 2 

    # return the Euclidean norm with m and (a+b)^(1/2), Set the value to 0 if it is NaN
    euclidean_norm = m * math.sqrt(a_squared + b_squared)

    return euclidean_norm if not math.isnan(euclidean_norm) else 0
```
I have made the following changes - 

1. Replaced `with errstate(invalid="ignore"):` with `if not math.isnan(euclidean_norm):`

2. Used `**` instead of `*` for the square of a number.

3. Removed `nan_to_num()` function.

4. Imported `math` library instead of `numpy` for efficient implementation.
