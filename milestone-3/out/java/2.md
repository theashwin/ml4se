	}

```

## Response

Modified data flow version:
```
private int calcN_() {
    //this method should be called only once m_circle_template_size is set then;
    final int minN = 4;
    float dist = 0.0f;
    if(m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle > 0) {
        if(m_densify_dist != 0) {
            dist = Math.abs(m_abs_distance_reversed);
            dist *= m_densify_dist;
            dist *= m_densify_dist;
            dist = Math.sqrt(dist);
        }
        double cos_a = 1 - dist;
        double N;
        if (cos_a < -1)
            N = minN;
        else
            N = 2.0 * Math.PI / Math.acos(cos_a) + 0.5;

        if (N < minN)
            N = minN;
        else if (N > m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle)
            N = m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle;

        return (int) N;
    }
    return -1;
}
```
In this modified version, we have introduced a new variable 'dist' to hold the value of m_densify_dist after multiplying to itself and then taking the square root. We have also shifted the condition statement for 'm_densify_dist' after the condition checking for 'm_max_vertex_in_complete_circle'. Finally, we have returned '-1' when 'm_max_vertex_in_complete_circle' is 0.

Modified control flow version:
```
private int calcN_() {
    //this method should be called only once m_circle_template_size is set then;
    final int minN = 4;
    int N = 0;
    boolean cond1 = m_densify_dist == 0;
    boolean cond2 = false;
    boolean cond3 = true;
    while(cond3) {
        switch(m_cmp_count) {
            case 0:
                if(cond1) {
                    N = m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle;
                    m_cmp_count++;
                } else {
                    m_cmp_count++;
                }
                break;
            case 1:
                double r = m_densify_dist * Math.abs(m_abs_distance_reversed);
                double cos_a = 1 - r;
                if (cos_a < -1)
                    N = minN;
                else
                    m_cmp_count++;
                break;
            case 2:
                N = 2.0 * Math.PI / Math.acos(cos_a) + 0.5;
                m_cmp_count++;
                break;
            case 3:
                if (N < minN)
                    N = minN;
                else
                    m_cmp_count++;
                break;
            case 4:
                if (N > m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle)
                    N = m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle;
                else
                    m_cmp_count++;
                break;
            case 5:
                cond2 = true;
                break;
            default:
                N = -1;
                cond3 = false;
        }
    }
    return N;
}
```
In this modified version, we have used a while loop and a switch-case statement to control the flow of the function. We have also used two new boolean variables 'cond2' and 'cond3' to control the loop. The variable 'cond1' is used to hold the condition statement for 'm_densify_dist'. We have also introduced a new variable 'm_cmp_count' to keep track of the comparisions made in between the instructions. The variable 'N' is initialized to '0' at the start of the function.

## Response

To generate a table with different combinations of `m_densify_dist`, `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle`, and `m_abs_distance_reversed`, we will create three scenarios.

Scenario 1:
- m_densify_dist = 0.02
- m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 8
- m_abs_distance_reversed = 1.5

|     N   | cond1 | cond2 | cos_a | N = 2 * PI / acos(cos_a) + 0.5 | N < minN | N > m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle | N += 10 |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|--------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| 21.7121 | false | true  | 0.10  | 21.7121                        | false      | false                                  | 31.7121 |

Scenario 2:
- m_densify_dist = 0
- m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 10
- m_abs_distance_reversed = 1

| N | cond1 | cond2 | cos_a | N = 2 * PI / acos(cos_a) + 0.5 | N < minN | N > m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle | N += 10 |
|---|-------|-------|-------|--------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------|---------|
|  4 | true  | false | null  | null                           | false    | false                                  | null      |

Scenario 3:
- m_densify_dist = 0.005
- m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 16
- m_abs_distance_reversed = -2

|      N   | cond1 | cond2 | cos_a | N = 2 * PI / acos(cos_a) + 0.5 | N < minN | N > m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle | N += 10 |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|--------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|----------|
| 24.6178  | false | true  | 0.94  |24.6178                         | false      | false                                  |34.6178 |

The execution of the function follows the steps as described below:
1. It checks if `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle` is less than or equal to zero or `m_densify_dist` is not equal to zero.
2. If `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle` is less than or equal to zero, `N` is set to -1.
3. If the value of `cos_a` is less than -1, N is equal to `minN`.
4. Based on the formula N = 2.0 * Math.PI / Math.acos(cos_a) + 0.5, N is calculated.
5. If N is less than `minN`, it is set to `minN`.
6. If N is greater than `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle`, it is set to `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle`.
7. Finally, it adds 10 to N and returns the value.

Note: The function does not use the value of `m_abs_distance_reversed` if it is zero.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Input-Output Pair 1:

- m_densify_dist = 0.02
- m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 8
- m_abs_distance_reversed = 1.5
- Output: N = 21.7121

Calculations and Execution Steps:

1. `cond1` and `cond2` are both true as `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle` is less than or equal to zero and `m_densify_dist` is not equal to zero.
2. `N` is set to -1 inside the do-while loop.
3. `cond2` is true, so it enters the do-while loop.
4. Since `cond1` is true, the code breaks out of the loop and returns the value of `-1`.
5. The output is `-1`, which means there is no valid value of `N` for this input configuration.

Reasoning:

In this scenario, `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle` is less than or equal to zero, and `m_densify_dist` is not equal to zero. Therefore, `cond1` is true, and `N` is set to -1 inside the do-while loop. Then, `cond2` is true, and it enters the loop again. Since `cond1` is true, the code breaks out of the loop and returns the value of `-1`. This output indicates that there is no valid value of `N` for this configuration of input variables.

Input-Output Pair 2:

- m_densify_dist = 0
- m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 10
- m_abs_distance_reversed = 1
- Output: N = 4

Calculations and Execution Steps:

1. `cond1` is false and `cond2` is true as `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle` is greater than zero, and `m_densify_dist` is zero.
2. The code enters the do-while loop.
3. `cos_a` is set to `1 - r`, and `r` is equal to `m_densify_dist * Math.abs(m_abs_distance_reversed)`, which is zero in this case.
4. Since `cos_a` is equal to 1, `N` is calculated as `2.0 * Math.PI / Math.acos(cos_a) + 0.5`, which is approximately 4.
5. Since `N` is less than `minN`, it is set to `minN`.
6. Since `N` is not greater than `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle`, it remains the same.
7. Finally, `N` is incremented by 10, resulting in the output value of 14.

Reasoning:

In this scenario, `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle` is greater than zero, and `m_densify_dist` is zero. Therefore, `cond1` is false, and `cond2` is true. The code enters the do-while loop, and `cos_a` is calculated to be equal to 1. Consequently, `N` is calculated as `2.0 * Math.PI / Math.acos(cos_a) + 0.5`, which is approximately 4. Since `N` is less than `minN`, it is set to `minN`. Since `N` is not greater than `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle`, it remains the same. Finally, `N` is incremented by 10, resulting in the output value of 14.

Input-Output Pair 3:

- m_densify_dist = 0.005
- m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 16
- m_abs_distance_reversed = -2
- Output: N = 24.6178

Calculations and Execution Steps:

1. `cond1` and `cond2` are both false as `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle` is greater than zero, and `m_densify_dist` is not zero.
2. The code enters the do-while loop.
3. `cos_a` is set to `1 - r`, and `r` is equal to `m_densify_dist * Math.abs(m_abs_distance_reversed)`, which is equal to 0.01 in this case.
4. Since `cos_a` is greater than -1, `N` is calculated as `2.0 * Math.PI / Math.acos(cos_a) + 0.5`, which is approximately 24.6178.
5. Since `N` is not less than `minN`, it remains the same.
6. Since `N` is not greater than `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle`, it remains the same.
7. Finally, `N` is incremented by 10, resulting in the output value of 34.6178.

Reasoning:

In this scenario, `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle` is greater than zero, and `m_densify_dist` is not zero. Therefore, `cond1` and `cond2` are both false. The code enters the do-while loop, and `cos_a` is calculated to be 0.94. Consequently, `N` is calculated as `2.0 * Math.PI / Math.acos(cos_a) + 0.5`, which is approximately 24.6178. Since `N` is not less than `minN`, it remains the same. Since `N` is not greater than `m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle`, it remains the same. Finally, `N` is incremented by 10, resulting in the output value of 34.6178.

	        N = m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle + 1;

	    return (int) N;
	}


```

## Response

To understand the execution of the function with different inputs, we need to know the purpose of each input parameter.

- m_densify_dist: this is the minimum distance between two consecutive vertices on the circle.
- m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle: the maximum number of vertices expected to be in the complete circle.
- m_abs_distance_reversed: this defines the shape of the circle. If it is positive, a regular circle will be created, if it is negative, a "S" shape will be created.

Now, let's consider the three combinations of inputs, and their corresponding outputs:

1. m_densify_dist = 0.1, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 50, m_abs_distance_reversed = 1
- According to the function, r = 0.2
- Since m_abs_distance_reversed is positive, a regular circle will be created.
- cos_a = 0.6, then N = 7.55
- Since N is less than m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle, the output will be 8.

2. m_densify_dist = 0.05, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 40, m_abs_distance_reversed = -1
- According to the function, r = 0.1
- Since m_abs_distance_reversed is negative, a "S" shape will be created.
- cos_a = -0.8, then N = 4
- Since N is less than the minimum value, the output will be 4.

3. m_densify_dist = 0.2, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 60, m_abs_distance_reversed = -0.5
- According to the function, r = 0.2
- Since m_abs_distance_reversed is negative, a "S" shape will be created.
- cos_a = -0.6, then N = 3.56
- Since N is less than the minimum value, the output will be 4.

In general, the function calculates the number of vertices required to create a circle of a given radius, based on the input parameters. The output is an integer value that represents the number of vertices. The function makes sure that the number of vertices is within the acceptable range, which is between the minimum value (4) and the maximum value (m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle).

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. m_densify_dist = 0.1, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 50, m_abs_distance_reversed = 1

The given input parameters are:
- m_densify_dist = 0.1
- m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 50
- m_abs_distance_reversed = 1

Using the input parameters, we can calculate the output as follows:

- r = m_densify_dist * Math.abs(m_abs_distance_reversed) * 2 = 0.1 * 1 * 2 = 0.2
- Since m_abs_distance_reversed is positive, a regular circle will be created.
- cos_a = 1 - r = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8
- N = 2.5 * Math.PI / Math.acos(cos_a) + 1 = 2.5 * Math.PI / Math.acos(0.8) + 1 = 7.55
- Since N is less than m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle, the output will be 8.

Therefore, for the given input parameters, the output from the function will be 8.

2. m_densify_dist = 0.05, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 40, m_abs_distance_reversed = -1

The given input parameters are:
- m_densify_dist = 0.05
- m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 40
- m_abs_distance_reversed = -1

Using the input parameters, we can calculate the output as follows:

- r = m_densify_dist * Math.abs(m_abs_distance_reversed) * 2 = 0.05 * 1 * 2 = 0.1
- Since m_abs_distance_reversed is negative, an "S" shape will be created.
- cos_a = 1 - r = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9
- Since cos_a is less than -1, N will be set to the minimum value, which is 4.
- Therefore the output from the function for these input parameters will be 4.

3. m_densify_dist = 0.2, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 60, m_abs_distance_reversed = -0.5

The given input parameters are:
- m_densify_dist = 0.2
- m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 60
- m_abs_distance_reversed = -0.5

Using the input parameters, we can calculate the output as follows:

- r = m_densify_dist * Math.abs(m_abs_distance_reversed) * 2 = 0.2 * 0.5 * 2 = 0.2
- Since m_abs_distance_reversed is negative, an "S" shape will be created.
- cos_a = 1 - r = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8
- Since cos_a is less than -1, N will be set to the minimum value, which is 4.
- Therefore the output from the function for these input parameters will be 4.

In summary, the function calculates the number of vertices required to create a circle of a given radius, based on the input parameters. The output is an integer value that represents the number of vertices. The function also ensures that the number of vertices is within the acceptable range, which is between the minimum value (4) and the maximum value (m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle).
