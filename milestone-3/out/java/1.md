# Task 1: Data Control

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. List out all of the changes done to the original function.**

**code:**

```

private void progress_() {
		m_progress_counter++;
		if (m_progress_counter % 1024 == 0) {
			if ((m_progress_tracker != null)
					&& !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)))
				throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
		}
	}

```

## Response

Modified function 1: (Changed data flow)

private void progress_() {
		if ((m_progress_counter+1) % 1024 == 0) {
			if ((m_progress_tracker != null)
					&& !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)))
				throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
		}
		else{
			m_progress_counter++;
		}
	}


Changes made: 
1. Instead of incrementing the m_progress_counter first, the counter is now being checked first for whether it's value is a multiple of 1024.
2. If the counter is a multiple of 1024, then the original code in the if statement runs.
3. If the counter is not a multiple of 1024, the original counter increment statement runs.


Modified function 2: (Changed Control flow)

private void progress_() {
		boolean success = false; //initialising the success variable
		if ((m_progress_counter % 1024 != 0 && m_progress_tracker != null) || m_progress_counter % 2048 == 0){
			success = m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1);
		}
		if (success == false) { //runs only when progress tracker returns false or counter is twice multiple of 1024
			throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
		}
		m_progress_counter++;
	}

Changes made:
1. The original code to increment the counter is now at the end of the function.
2. A new boolean variable "success" is introduced which will hold the return value of "m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)".
3. Next, control enters first "if" condition where it checks whether "m_progress_counter" is a multiple of 1024 or 2048. If it is multiple of 1024, "m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)" is executed, and this function decides whether to return true or false.
4. If "m_progress_counter" is the multiple of 2048, it directly executes "m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)" because 2048 is a multiple of 1024, and hence, counter of 2048 will also be multiples of 1024.
5. If this function returns false, this means that the progress has been canceled and it does not increment the counter but throws the exception.

```

## Response

The function `progress_()` takes no input and returns nothing. It updates the progress status of the task being executed. Here are some possible combinations of `m_progress_counter` and outputs:

1. If `m_progress_counter = 0`:
   - The condition `(m_progress_counter % 1024 != 0 && m_progress_tracker != null) || m_progress_counter % 2048 == 0` is true because `0 % 2048 == 0`.
   - `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)` is called with `-1` as parameters, indicating that progress is indeterminate.
   - The value of `success` is set to the return value of `m_progress_tracker.progress()`, which may be true or false depending on the progress tracker's implementation.
   - The value of `m_progress_counter` is incremented to `1`.
   - No exception is thrown because `success` is not equal to false.
   
2. If `m_progress_counter = 1023`:
   - The condition `(m_progress_counter % 1024 != 0 && m_progress_tracker != null) || m_progress_counter % 2048 == 0` is true because `1023 % 1024 != 0`.
   - `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)` is not called because the second part of the condition is false (`1023 % 2048 != 0`).
   - The value of `success` is set to false because no progress is made.
   - A `RuntimeException` with the message "user_canceled" is thrown because `success` is false.
   - The value of `m_progress_counter` is not incremented.
   
3. If `m_progress_counter = 2048`:
   - The condition `(m_progress_counter % 1024 != 0 && m_progress_tracker != null) || m_progress_counter % 2048 == 0` is true because `2048 % 2048 == 0`.
   - `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)` is called with `-1` as parameters, indicating that progress is indeterminate.
   - The value of `success` is set to the return value of `m_progress_tracker.progress()`, which may be true or false depending on the progress tracker's implementation.
   - The value of `m_progress_counter` is incremented to `2049`.
   - No exception is thrown because `success` is not equal to false.

The function increments the `m_progress_counter` variable at the end regardless of the outcome of the progress update. If the progress tracker is null or returns false, the function throws a runtime exception with the message "user_canceled". Otherwise, the function continues execution normally.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Sure, here are the stepwise calculations and reasons about the execution of `progress_()` with each of the input-output pairs:

1. If `m_progress_counter = 0`:
   - The first part of the condition is false (`0 % 1024 == 0`). The second part of the condition is true (`0 % 2048 == 0`).
   - `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)` is called with `-1` as parameters, indicating that progress is indeterminate.
   - Assume that the progress tracker implementation returns true.
   - The value of `success` is set to true.
   - The value of `m_progress_counter` is incremented to `1`.
   - The function exits normally.

2. If `m_progress_counter = 1023`:
   - The first part of the condition is true (`1023 % 1024 != 0`). The second part of the condition is false (`1023 % 2048 != 0`).
   - `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)` is not called.
   - The value of `success` is set to false.
   - A `RuntimeException` with the message "user_canceled" is thrown because `success` is false. The function does not complete its execution.

3. If `m_progress_counter = 2048`:
   - The first part of the condition is false (`2048 % 1024 == 0`). The second part of the condition is true (`2048 % 2048 == 0`).
   - `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)` is called with `-1` as parameters, indicating that progress is indeterminate.
   - Assume that the progress tracker implementation returns true.
   - The value of `success` is set to true.
   - The value of `m_progress_counter` is incremented to `2049`.
   - The function exits normally.

In summary, the function updates the progress status of the task being executed based on the value of `m_progress_counter`. If `m_progress_counter` is not a multiple of 1024 and the progress tracker is not null, or if `m_progress_counter` is a multiple of 2048, then the function calls the progress tracker to update progress. If the progress tracker returns false, the function throws a runtime exception with the message "user_canceled". The `m_progress_counter` is incremented at the end of every iteration.

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three combination of m_progress_counter and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```


private void progress_() {
		if ((m_progress_counter+1) % 1024 == 0) {
			if ((m_progress_tracker != null)
					&& !(m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)))
				throw new RuntimeException("user_canceled");
		}
		else{
			m_progress_counter++;
		}
	}


```

## Response

To generate the table, we will vary the value of `m_progress_counter` and observe the behavior of the function. The output of the function is determined by the return value of the `m_progress_tracker.progress(-1, -1)` function, which is not provided in the code. Therefore, we will assume that it returns a boolean value indicating whether the progress tracker should continue or not.

| m_progress_counter | Output     |
|--------------------|------------|
| 0                  | m_progress_counter is incremented by 1 |
| 1023               | m_progress_counter is incremented by 1 |
| 1024               | If m_progress_tracker is not null and its progress method returns true, m_progress_counter is reset to 0. If progress method returns false, a RuntimeException with "user_canceled" message is thrown. |
| 2047               | m_progress_counter is incremented by 1 |
| 2048               | If m_progress_tracker is not null and its progress method returns true, m_progress_counter is reset to 0. If progress method returns false, a RuntimeException with "user_canceled" message is thrown. |
| 3071               | m_progress_counter is incremented by 1 |

Each time the method is called, `m_progress_counter` is incremented by one. If `m_progress_counter` is a multiple of 1024, the progress tracker is consulted. If the progress tracker returns false, indicating that the user has canceled the operation, a RuntimeException is thrown. If the progress tracker returns true, `m_progress_counter` is reset to 0.

Note that the check for null progress tracker is not required, as Java will throw a NullPointerException if a null object is dereferenced. However, including the check avoids the exception and allows the function to fail gracefully if the progress tracker is not set.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Sure! Here are the explanations for each input-output pair:

1. m_progress_counter = 0, Output: m_progress_counter is incremented by 1.

   In this case, since m_progress_counter = 0, it is not a multiple of 1024. Therefore, the if condition `if ((m_progress_counter+1) % 1024 == 0)` is false, and the else branch is executed. This increments the value of `m_progress_counter` by 1, resulting in `m_progress_counter = 1`.

2. m_progress_counter = 1023, Output: m_progress_counter is incremented by 1.

   Similar to the previous case, m_progress_counter is not a multiple of 1024. Therefore, the else branch is executed, incrementing the value of `m_progress_counter` by 1, resulting in `m_progress_counter = 1024`.

3. m_progress_counter = 1024, Output: If m_progress_tracker is not null and its progress method returns true, m_progress_counter is reset to 0. If progress method returns false, a RuntimeException with "user_canceled" message is thrown.

   Here, m_progress_counter is a multiple of 1024. Therefore, the if condition `if ((m_progress_counter+1) % 1024 == 0)` is true. We then check if the progress tracker is not null and its progress method returns true. If these conditions are satisfied, m_progress_counter is reset to 0. Otherwise, a RuntimeException is thrown with "user_canceled" message.

   Since we don't have any information about the progress tracker or its progress method, we cannot determine the exact output of the function in this case. However, we know that if the progress method returns false, the function will throw a RuntimeException. If the progress method returns true, `m_progress_counter` will be reset to 0.

   Therefore, we can say that the function may reset m_progress_counter to 0, or throw a RuntimeException with "user_canceled" message, depending on the progress tracker's behavior.
