# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. List out all of the changes done to the original function.**

**code:**

```

static double truncate(double v) {
		if (v >= 0)
			return Math.floor(v);
		else
			return -Math.floor(-v);
	}

```

## Response

First version with changed data flow: 

```
/**
* This method takes a double value and removes the fraction by flooring it.
* 
* @param v the double value to truncate
* @return the truncated value with no fraction
*/

static double truncate(double v) {
    int intValue = (int) v;
    double diff = v - intValue;
    if (diff >= 0.5) {
        return Math.ceil(v);
    } else {
        return intValue;
    }
}
```

Changes made: 
- Instead of checking if the input value is greater than or equal to zero, we converted the input value to an integer and subtracted it from the original value to get the decimal difference. 
- Used the decimal difference to determine whether we should round up or down the original value, then either rounded up or returned the original integer value. 

Second version with changed control flow:

```
/**
* This method takes a double value and removes the fraction by flooring it.
* 
* @param v the double value to truncate
* @return the truncated value with no fraction
*/

static double truncate(double v) {
    if (v < 0) {
        return -Math.floor(-v);
    } else if (v == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY || Double.isNaN(v)) {
        return Double.NaN;
    } else {
        return Math.floor(v);
    }
}
```

Changes made: 
- Reversed the if/else statement to check if the input value is less than zero first. 
- Added a check to see if the input value is either positive infinity or not a number, in which case we return NaN. 
- Return the equivalent of the original method for input values greater than or equal to zero.

## Prompt

**Write the data flow mutated function in <data> </data> tags and control flow mutated function in <control> </control> tags.**

## Response

Data flow mutated function: 

```
<data>
/**
* This method takes a double value and removes the fraction by flooring it.
* 
* @param v the double value to truncate
* @return the truncated value with no fraction
*/

static double truncate(double v) {
    int intValue = (int) v;
    double diff = v - intValue;
    if (diff >= 0.5) {
        return Math.ceil(v);
    } else {
        return intValue;
    }
}
</data>
```

Control flow mutated function:

```
<control>
/**
* This method takes a double value and removes the fraction by flooring it.
* 
* @param v the double value to truncate
* @return the truncated value with no fraction
*/

static double truncate(double v) {
    if (v < 0) {
        return -Math.floor(-v);
    } else if (v == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY || Double.isNaN(v)) {
        return Double.NaN;
    } else {
        return Math.floor(v);
    }
}
</control>
```

## Prompt

## Response

Table:

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 3.141 | 3.0    |
| -1.234 | -1.0   |
| Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY | Double.NaN |

Concise explanation of the function's behavior:

1. The function takes a double value as input.
2. It first checks if the input value is negative. If it is negative, it floors the absolute value of the input, negates it and returns it. This is because flooring a negative value will make it more negative, so we need to negate it to get the correct truncation.
3. If the input is not negative, it checks if it is infinity or NaN. If it is, it returns NaN.
4. If none of the above cases apply, it floors the input and returns the result.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. Input: 3.141

   Output: 3.0

   Execution:
   
   - The input value, 3.141, is not negative.
   - It is not infinity or NaN.
   - The function returns Math.floor(3.141) which is 3.0. Therefore, the function returns 3.0 as output.

2. Input: -1.234

   Output: -1.0

   Execution:
   
   - The input value, -1.234, is negative.
   - The function returns -Math.floor(-(-1.234)) which is -Math.floor(1.234). 
   - Math.floor(1.234) is 1.0 because flooring a positive number less than 2 will give 1.
   - Negating 1.0 gives -1.0, which is the final output. Therefore, the function returns -1.0 as output.

3. Input: Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY

   Output: Double.NaN

   Execution:
   
   - The input value is Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY which is infinity.
   - It returns Double.NaN as output. Therefore, the function returns Double.NaN as output. 

Reasoning: 

In the first case, the input value is positive and finite. Therefore, the function returns the floor of the input value, which is 3.0.

In the second case, the input value is negative. Therefore, the absolute value of the input value, 1.234 will be passed to Math.floor() function. It is used so that flooring the negative of the absolute value of the input gives the correct truncation. The floor of the absolute value of the input value is 1.0 according to the function. Negating that floor value gives -1.0, which is the correct truncated value.

In the third case, the input value is either infinity or NaN, which are not finite numbers. Therefore, the function returns NaN as output.

## Response

Input/output table:

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 3.1415 | 3.0    |
| -5.678 | -6.0   |
| 9.9999 | 9.0    |

Explanation:

1. When the input is 3.1415, the integer value will be 3, and the fraction part will be 0.1415. As the fraction part is less than 0.5, the function will return the integer value 3.

2. When the input is -5.678, the integer value will be -5, and the fraction part will be -0.678. As the fraction part is less than 0.5, the function will return the integer value -6.

3. When the input is 9.9999, the integer value will be 9, and the fraction part will be 0.9999. As the fraction part is greater than or equal to 0.5, the function will return the ceiling value of the input, which is 10.

Overall, the function takes an input in double value and removes the fraction by flooring it. It does this by checking if the fraction value is greater than or equal to 0.5, in which case it returns the ceiling value of the input, and if it's less than 0.5, it just returns the integer value.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. Input: 3.1415

    - The integer value of 3.1415 is 3, which is assigned to the variable `intValue`.
    
    - The fraction value of 3.1415 is 0.1415, which is assigned to the variable `diff`.
    
    - As `diff` is less than 0.5, the `if` condition fails and the function returns `intValue`, which is 3.
    
    - Output: 3.0
    
2. Input: -5.678

    - The integer value of -5.678 is -5, which is assigned to the variable `intValue`.
    
    - The fraction value of -5.678 is -0.678, which is assigned to the variable `diff`.
    
    - As `diff` is less than 0.5, the `if` condition fails and the function returns `intValue`, which is -6 due to flooring.
    
    - Output: -6.0
    
3. Input: 9.9999

    - The integer value of 9.9999 is 9, which is assigned to the variable `intValue`.
    
    - The fraction value of 9.9999 is 0.9999, which is assigned to the variable `diff`.
    
    - As `diff` is greater than or equal to 0.5, the `if` condition passes and the function returns `Math.ceil(v)`, which is 10 due to rounding up.
    
    - Output: 10.0
    
Overall, the function takes a double value, gets its integer and fraction parts, and based on the fraction value, either rounds it down or up to the nearest whole number.
