# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

static double truncate(double v) {
		if (v >= 0)
			return Math.floor(v);
		else
			return -Math.floor(-v);
	}

```

## Response

Data Flow Version:
```
// This function takes a double as input and returns a truncated version of this double.

static double truncate(double v) {
		if (v >= 0)
			return Math.ceil(v);
		else
			return -Math.ceil(-v);
}
```

Control Flow Version:
```
// This function takes a double as input and returns a truncated version of this double.

static double truncate(double v) {
		if (v < 0)
			return -Math.floor(-v);
		else
			return Math.floor(v);
}
```

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in <DATA> </DATA> tags and control flow mutated function in <CONTROL> </CONTROL> tags.**

## Response

<DATA>
  
```
// This function takes a double as input and returns a truncated version of this double.

static double truncate(double v) {
		if (v >= 0)
			return Math.ceil(v);

}
```
</DATA>

<CONTROL>

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```


  
```
// This function takes a double as input and returns a truncated version of this double.

static double truncate(double v) {
		if (v < 0)
			return -Math.floor(-v);
		else
			return Math.floor(v);
}
```


```

## Response

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 3.14159 | 3.0 |
| -3.14159 | -3.0 |
| 0.9999 | 0.0 |

Execution of the function:
1. The input double value v is received by the function `truncate()`.
2. If the value of v is less than 0, Math.floor(-v) is used to round down the absolute value of v to the nearest integer and make it negative, then a negative truncated value is returned.
3. If the value of v is greater than or equal to 0, Math.floor(v) is used to round down v to the nearest integer, then the truncated value is returned.
4. This truncated value is the final output of the function.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

For the given function:

```
static double truncate(double v) {
    if (v < 0)
        return -Math.floor(-v);
    else
        return Math.floor(v);
}
```

| Input | v | v < 0 | -v | -v rounded down using Math.floor | Truncated Value |
|-------|---|-------|----|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| 3.14159 | 3.14159 <br> Since v >= 0, Math.floor(v) will be used in the else part of the if-else condition | false | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | 3.0 |
| -3.14159 | -3.14159 <br> Since v < 0, -Math.floor(-v) will be used in the if part of the if-else condition | true | 3.14159 | 3.0 | -3.0 |
| 0.9999 | 0.9999 <br> Since v >= 0, Math.floor(v) will be used in the else part of the if-else condition | false | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | 0.0 |

For the first input, the value of `v` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `Math.floor(v)` is used, which rounds down `v` to the nearest integer and returns the value 3.0 as the truncated value.

For the second input, the value of `v` is less than 0. Therefore, `-Math.floor(-v)` is used, which first makes the absolute value of `v` equal to 3.14159 (since `-(-3.14159)=3.14159`). Then it rounds down the value of `3.14159` to the nearest integer, which is 3, and returns a negative truncated value, `-3.0`.

For the third input, the value of `v` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `Math.floor(v)` is used, which rounds down `v` to the nearest integer and returns the value 0.0 as the truncated value.

## Response

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 4.2   | 5.0    |
| -4.2  | -4.0   |
| 0     | 0.0    |

1. For input `4.2`, since `v` is greater than or equal to `0`, the function executes the `return Math.ceil(v);` statement, which returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `v`, i.e., `5.0`.

2. For input `-4.2`, since `v` is less than `0`, the function executes the `return -Math.ceil(-v);` statement, which returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `-v` and then negates it. `-v` is equal to `4.2`, and the smallest integer greater than or equal to `4.2` is `5.0`. Thus, `-5.0` is returned.

3. For input `0`, since `v` is equal to `0`, the function executes the `return Math.ceil(v);` statement, which returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `v`, i.e., `0.0`.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. For input `4.2`:
Since `v = 4.2 >= 0`, the `if` statement is true and control enters the if block, executing `return Math.ceil(v);`. Here, `Math.ceil(v)` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `v`, which is `5.0`. Hence, the output is `5.0`.

2. For input `-4.2`:
Since `v = -4.2 < 0`, the `if` statement is false and control enters the else block, executing `return -Math.ceil(-v);`. Here, `-v`, which is `-(-4.2)` or `4.2`, is passed as an argument to `Math.ceil()`. The `Math.ceil()` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `4.2`, which is `5.0`. Finally, the output is `-5.0`, as `-` operator is used to negate `5.0`.

3. For input `0`:
Since `v = 0`, the `if` statement is false and control enters the else block, executing `return -Math.ceil(-v);`. Here, `-v`, which is `-0` or `0`, is passed as an argument to `Math.ceil()`. The `Math.ceil()` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `0`, which is `0`. Finally, the output is `0.0`, as `-` operator is not used since `0` is a non-negative number.
