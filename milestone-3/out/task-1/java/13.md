# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

  public static String toolTipText(GeometryFunction func) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append("<html>");
    sb.append(func.getSignature());
    String desc = func.getDescription();
    if (desc != null) sb.append("<br>" + desc);
    sb.append("</html>");
    return sb.toString();
  }

```

## Response

First version with changed data flow:

```
public static String toolTipText(GeometryFunction func) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append("<html>");
    String desc = func.getDescription();
    if (desc != null) {
        sb.append("<br>" + desc.toUpperCase());
    }
    sb.append(func.getSignature().toLowerCase());
    sb.append("</html>");
    return sb.toString();
}
```

Second version with changed control flow:

```
public static String toolTipText(GeometryFunction func) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append("<html>");
    String desc = func.getDescription();
    if (desc != null) {
        sb.append("<br>" + desc.replace(" ", "&nbsp;"));
        sb.append(func.getSignature().toLowerCase());
    } else {
        sb.append(func.getSignature().toUpperCase());
    }
    sb.append("</html>");
    return sb.toString();
}
``` 

In the first version, we change the data flow by modifying the way the signature and description strings are appended to the StringBuilder. The getDescription() string is now concatenated with its contents in upper case, and the getSignature() string is now concatenated with its contents in lower case.

In the second version, we change the control flow by changing the order in which the signature and description strings are appended to the StringBuilder, and by adding some HTML to the description string. We also change how the signature and description strings are formatted if there is no description present. If there is a description, the description is added to the StringBuilder with spaces replaced by the HTML entity for non-breaking spaces, and the signature is added in lower case. If there is no description, the signature is added to the StringBuilder in upper case.

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in <DATA> </DATA> tags and control flow mutated function in <CONTROL> </CONTROL> tags.**

## Response

First version with changed data flow enclosed in <DATA> </DATA> tags:

```
<DATA>
public static String toolTipText(GeometryFunction func) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append("<html>");
    String desc = func.getDescription();
    if (desc != null) {
        sb.append("<br>" + desc.toUpperCase());
    }
    sb.append(func.getSignature().toLowerCase());
    sb.append("</html>");
    return sb.toString();
}
</DATA>
```

Second version with changed control flow enclosed in <CONTROL> </CONTROL> tags:

```
<CONTROL>
public static String toolTipText(GeometryFunction func) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append("<html>");
    String desc = func.getDescription();
    if (desc != null) {
        sb.append("<br>" + desc.replace(" ", "&nbsp;"));
        sb.append(func.getSignature().toLowerCase());
    } else {
        sb.append(func.getSignature().toUpperCase());
    }
    sb.append("</html>");
    return sb.toString();
}
</CONTROL>
``` 

In the first version enclosed in <DATA> </DATA> tags, we modify the data flow of the original function by changing the way the signature and description strings are concatenated. The getDescription() string is changed to uppercase, and the getSignature() string is changed to lowercase.

In the second version enclosed in <CONTROL> </CONTROL> tags, we modify the control flow of the original function by changing the order of the signature and description strings concatenated in the StringBuilder. If there is a description, we add it first with spaces replaced by the HTML entity for a non-breaking space, and then we add the signature in lowercase. If there is no description, we add the signature in uppercase.

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

I'm sorry, but since you have not provided the code, I cannot provide calculations and reasons for its execution for any input-output pairs. Please provide the code if you want me to continue assisting you.
