# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

int getVertexByIDImpl_(int vertex, int geometry_id) {
    EditShape shape = m_topo_graph.getShape();
    int v;
    int geometry;
    int vertex_iterator = m_topo_graph
            .getClusterVertexIterator(m_topo_graph
                    .getClusterFromVertex(vertex));

    do {
        v = m_topo_graph.getVertexFromVertexIterator(vertex_iterator);
        geometry = shape.getGeometryFromPath(shape.getPathFromVertex(v));

        if (geometry == geometry_id)
            return v;

        vertex_iterator = m_topo_graph
                .incrementVertexIterator(vertex_iterator);
    } while (vertex_iterator != -1);

    return vertex;
}

```

## Response

First version - Data flow changed:
```
int getVertexByIDImpl_(int vertex, int geometry_id) {
    EditShape shape = m_topo_graph.getShape();
    int v = -1;
    int geometry;
    int vertex_iterator = m_topo_graph
            .getClusterVertexIterator(m_topo_graph
                    .getClusterFromVertex(vertex));

    while (vertex_iterator != -1) {
        v = m_topo_graph.getVertexFromVertexIterator(vertex_iterator);
        geometry = shape.getGeometryFromPath(shape.getPathFromVertex(v));

        if (geometry == geometry_id){
            break;
        }

        vertex_iterator = m_topo_graph
                .incrementVertexIterator(vertex_iterator);
    }

    return v;
}
```
In this version, the do-while loop was changed to a while loop. Additionally, we added a variable initialization as v=-1. In the original code, if no geometry was found, the vertex argument was returned. However, since v starts as -1 in our modified version, this becomes the value returned by default.

Second version - Control flow changed:
```
int getVertexByIDImpl_(int vertex, int geometry_id) {
    do {
        doWork(vertex, geometry_id);
        if(isFound()){
            return getResult();
        }

        vertex = getNewVertex()    
    } while (notDone(vertex));
    
    // Default case
    return -1;
}
```
In this version, we replaced the original loop with a do-while loop that calls an auxiliary function doWork(). This function checks if the geometry matches the geometry_id, and sets a flag isFound accordingly. If the flag is true, getResult() returns the currently evaluated vertex. In case none of the vertices match the condition, the function returns -1. The notDone() function determines whether there are more vertices left to check. getNewVertex() returns the next vertex.

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```
int getVertexByIDImpl_(int vertex, int geometry_id) {
    do {
        doWork(vertex, geometry_id);
        if(isFound()){
            return getResult();
        }

        vertex = getNewVertex()    
    } while (notDone(vertex));
    
    // Default case
    return -1;
}
```

## Response

Table of inputs and outputs:


| Input | geometry_id | vertex | Output |
|-------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1     | 10          | 5      | -1     |
| 15    | 7           | 2      | 8      |
| 6     | 8           | 4      | -1     |


Execution of the function:

- The function takes two integer parameters: vertex and geometry_id.
- The function executes a block of code inside a do-while loop.
- Inside the do-while loop, the function calls a function named 'doWork' with two arguments: vertex and geometry_id. This function executes some work with the given vertex and geometry_id.
- After executing the doWork function, the function checks if there is a result using the 'isFound' function. If the result is present, the function returns the result by calling 'getResult' function.
- If the result is not found, the function calls the 'getNewVertex' function which returns a new value for the vertex.
- The loop continues to execute until the 'notDone' function returns false for the current value of the vertex.
- If the loop completes without finding the result, the function returns -1 as the default case.

To summarize, the function iteratively executes the 'doWork' function on a series of vertices starting from the input vertex and checking if the result is found. If the loop ends without finding the result, the function returns -1.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. Input: `geometry_id = 10`, `vertex = 5`, Output: -1

    - The function starts with geometry_id = 10 and vertex = 5
    - It calls the 'doWork' function with vertex = 5 and geometry_id = 10
    - The 'isFound' function returns false, as the result is not present
    - It calls the 'getNewVertex' function which provides a new value of vertex
    - The loop continues to execute as 'notDone' function returns true for the new value of vertex
    - The process repeats until 'notDone' function returns false for all vertices
    - The function returns -1 as no result was found for the given input vertex and geometry_id

2. Input: `geometry_id = 15`, `vertex = 2`, Output: 8

    - The function starts with geometry_id = 15 and vertex = 2
    - It calls the 'doWork' function with vertex = 2 and geometry_id = 15
    - The 'isFound' function returns false, as the result is not present
    - It calls the 'getNewVertex' function which provides a new value of vertex
    - The loop continues to execute as 'notDone' function returns true for the new value of vertex
    - It calls the 'doWork' function with vertex = 8 and geometry_id = 15
    - The 'isFound' function returns true, with a result of 8
    - The function returns the result 8 as it was found for the given input vertex and geometry_id

3. Input: `geometry_id = 6`, `vertex = 4`, Output: -1

    - The function starts with geometry_id = 6 and vertex = 4
    - It calls the 'doWork' function with vertex = 4 and geometry_id = 6
    - The 'isFound' function returns false, as the result is not present
    - It calls the 'getNewVertex' function which provides a new value of vertex
    - The loop continues to execute as 'notDone' function returns true for the new value of vertex
    - It calls the 'doWork' function with vertex = 2 and geometry_id = 6
    - The 'isFound' function returns false, as the result is not present
    - It calls the 'getNewVertex' function which provides a new value of vertex
    - The loop continues to execute as 'notDone' function returns true for the new value of vertex
    - The process repeats until 'notDone' function returns false for all vertices
    - The function returns -1 as no result was found for the given input vertex and geometry_id

```

## Response

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| vertex=1, geometry_id=1 | Returns a vertex ID that exists in the topology graph. |
| vertex=3, geometry_id=2 | Returns -1 indicating that the vertex with the given geometry_id does not exist in the topology graph. |
| vertex=5, geometry_id=3 | Returns a vertex ID that exists in the topology graph. |

Execution of the function:

1. Initialize variables `v`, `geometry`, and `vertex_iterator`
2. Retrieve `EditShape` object from `m_topo_graph`
3. Loop through vertices connected to the same cluster as the input `vertex`
4. Get the vertex ID from the current `vertex_iterator`
5. Retrieve the geometry ID of the vertex
6. If the current vertex's geometry ID matches the input `geometry_id`, break out of the loop
7. Increment the `vertex_iterator`
8. Return the vertex ID, which is either the last vertex that was checked or the vertex that matches the input `geometry_id`. If no vertex was found, return -1.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. vertex=1, geometry_id=1:

- Initialize variables:
  - `v = -1, geometry = 0, vertex_iterator = starting iterator value`
- Retrieve `EditShape` object from `m_topo_graph`
- Loop through each vertex connected to the same cluster as input vertex '1':
  - vertex_iterator = 0 (starting iterator value)
  - Check vertex ID 0
  - geometry = 1 (from 'EditShape' object)
  - geometry != geometry_id, hence increment vertex_iterator
  - vertex_iterator = -1 (end of vertex list)
- This function returns last checked vertex ID, which is 0.

2. vertex=3, geometry_id=2:

- Initialize variables:
  - `v = -1, geometry = 0, vertex_iterator = starting iterator value`
- Retrieve `EditShape` object from `m_topo_graph`
- Loop through each vertex connected to the same cluster as input vertex '3':
  - vertex_iterator = 2 (starting iterator value)
  - Check vertex ID 2
  - geometry = 2 (from 'EditShape' object)
  - geometry == geometry_id, hence exit loop
- This function returns vertex ID, which is 2.

3. vertex=5, geometry_id=3:

- Initialize variables:
  - `v = -1, geometry = 0, vertex_iterator = starting iterator value`
- Retrieve `EditShape` object from `m_topo_graph`
- Loop through each vertex connected to the same cluster as input vertex '5':
  - vertex_iterator = 4 (starting iterator value)
  - Check vertex ID 4
  - geometry = 3 (from 'EditShape' object)
  - geometry == geometry_id, hence exit loop
- This function returns vertex ID, which is 4.
