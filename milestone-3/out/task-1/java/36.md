# Task 1: Data Control

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

int getVertexByID_(int vertex, int geometry_id) {
    if (geometry_id == -1)
        return vertex;

    return getVertexByIDImpl_(vertex, geometry_id);
}

```

## Response

Changed Data Flow version: 

In this version, Instead of returning the vertex or recursively calling the same function as the getVertexByIDImpl_, we're going to throw an exception, let's say NoVertexFoundException if the geometry_id equals to -1. If not, we can return the vertex + geometry_id.

```
class NoVertexFoundException extends Exception {
  public NoVertexFoundException(String message) {
    super(message);
  }
}

int getVertexByID_(int vertex, int geometry_id) throws NoVertexFoundException {
    if (geometry_id == -1) {
        throw new NoVertexFoundException("No Vertex Found");
    }
    else {
        return vertex + geometry_id;
    }
}
```

Changed Control Flow version:

In this version, Instead of calling another function to get the vertex, we can change it to have a switch statement to get the correct vertex based on the geometry_id. If the geometry_id is not equal to any one of those that we have in the switch statement, we can return -1.
```
int getVertexByID_(int vertex, int geometry_id) {
    int result = -1;
    switch(geometry_id){
        case 0:
            result = vertex + 1;
            break;
        case 1:
            result = vertex + 2;
            break;
        case 2:
            result = vertex + 3;
            break;
        default:
            result = -1;
            break;
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```


```
int getVertexByID_(int vertex, int geometry_id) {
    int result = -1;
    switch(geometry_id){
        case 0:
            result = vertex + 1;
            break;
        case 1:
            result = vertex + 2;
            break;
        case 2:
            result = vertex + 3;
            break;
        default:
            result = -1;
            break;
    }
    return result;

```


```

## Response

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 3, 1 | 5      |
| 7, 0 | 8      |
| 0, 2 | 3      |

Execution:
1. Declare a function named 'getVertexByID_' that accepts two integer parameters: 'vertex' and 'geometry_id'.
2. Initialize a variable 'result' with -1.
3. Using a switch statement, check the value of 'geometry_id'.
4. If the value of 'geometry_id' is 0, add 1 to 'vertex' to get the value of 'result'.
5. If the value of 'geometry_id' is 1, add 2 to 'vertex' to get the value of 'result'.
6. If the value of 'geometry_id' is 2, add 3 to 'vertex' to get the value of 'result'.
7. If the value of 'geometry_id' is not 0, 1, or 2, set 'result' to -1.
8. Return the value of 'result'.
Thus, the function takes two integer inputs, 'vertex' and 'geometry_id', and returns an integer output 'result'. The function checks the value of 'geometry_id' and updates 'result' based on the value. If the value of 'geometry_id' matches any of the cases in the switch statement, it adds the corresponding integer value to 'vertex', otherwise, it sets 'result' to -1. The final value of 'result' is then returned.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

For Input 1: getVertexByID_(3, 1)

1. 'vertex' is initialized to 3 and 'geometry_id' is initialized to 1.
2. 'result' is initialized to -1.
3. The switch statement checks the value of 'geometry_id' which is 1.
4. Case 1 is met, hence, 2 is added to 'vertex' to update 'result'.
5. 'result' now has a value of 5.
6. The function returns the value of 'result' which is 5.

For Input 2: getVertexByID_(7, 0)

1. 'vertex' is initialized to 7 and 'geometry_id' is initialized to 0.
2. 'result' is initialized to -1.
3. The switch statement checks the value of 'geometry_id' which is 0.
4. Case 0 is met, hence, 1 is added to 'vertex' to update 'result'.
5. 'result' now has a value of 8.
6. The function returns the value of 'result' which is 8.

For Input 3: getVertexByID_(0, 2)

1. 'vertex' is initialized to 0 and 'geometry_id' is initialized to 2.
2. 'result' is initialized to -1.
3. The switch statement checks the value of 'geometry_id' which is 2.
4. Case 2 is met, hence, 3 is added to 'vertex' to update 'result'.
5. 'result' now has a value of 3.
6. The function returns the value of 'result' which is 3.

In all three cases, the function works as expected. It takes the two inputs, 'vertex' and 'geometry_id' and updates 'result' based on the value of the latter variable. Finally, the output is returned, which is the value of 'result'.

## Response

Inputs:

1. `vertex = 10, geometry_id = 5`
2. `vertex = 0, geometry_id = -1`
3. `vertex = -3, geometry_id = 2`

Outputs:


| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| `vertex = 10, geometry_id = 5` | `getVertexByID_(10, 5)` will return `15` |
| `vertex = 0, geometry_id = -1` | `getVertexByID_(0, -1)` will throw `NoVertexFoundException` with message "No Vertex Found" |
| `vertex = -3, geometry_id = 2` | `getVertexByID_(-3, 2)` will return `-1` |


Explanation:

- In the given code, there is a custom exception class named `NoVertexFoundException`.
- The function `getVertexByID_` takes two integers as inputs: `vertex` and `geometry_id`.
- The function returns the sum of `vertex` and `geometry_id`, unless `geometry_id` is equal to `-1`.
- If `geometry_id` is `-1`, then the function throws a `NoVertexFoundException` with the message "No Vertex Found".
- For the first input, `geometry_id` is not `-1`, so the function returns the sum of `vertex` and `geometry_id`, which is `15`.
- For the second input, `geometry_id` is `-1`, so the function throws a `NoVertexFoundException` with the message "No Vertex Found".
- For the third input, `geometry_id` is not `-1`, but the sum of `vertex` and `geometry_id` is `-1`.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Input 1: `vertex = 10, geometry_id = 5`

To execute this input, the function `getVertexByID_` is called with `vertex` set to 10 and `geometry_id` set to 5. We can see from the function code that `geometry_id` is not equal to -1, so the function returns the sum of `vertex` and `geometry_id`, which is `15`. Therefore, the output for this input is `15`.

```
getVertexByID_(10, 5)
= 10 + 5
= 15
```

Input 2: `vertex = 0, geometry_id = -1`

To execute this input, the function `getVertexByID_` is called with `vertex` set to 0 and `geometry_id` set to -1. We can see from the function code that `geometry_id` is equal to -1, so the function throws a `NoVertexFoundException` with the message "No Vertex Found". Therefore, the output for this input is a `NoVertexFoundException` with message "No Vertex Found".

```
getVertexByID_(0, -1)
= throw NoVertexFoundException("No Vertex Found")
```

Input 3: `vertex = -3, geometry_id = 2`

To execute this input, the function `getVertexByID_` is called with `vertex` set to -3 and `geometry_id` set to 2. We can see from the function code that `geometry_id` is not equal to -1, so the function returns the sum of `vertex` and `geometry_id`, which is `-1`. Therefore, the output for this input is `-1`.

```
getVertexByID_(-3, 2)
= -3 + 2
= -1
```
