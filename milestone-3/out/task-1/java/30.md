# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

public double getDistance() {
		if (isEmpty())
			throw new GeometryException("invalid call");

		return m_distance;
	}

```

## Response

Modified Function 1: (Data flow changed)
```
public double getDistance(int[] data) {
  int sum = 0;
  for(int i=0; i<data.length; i++) {
    sum += data[i];
  }
  return sum/data.length;
}
```
Explanation: The original function 'getDistance' returns a variable 'm_distance', but it checks if the object is empty or not. In the modified function, I have changed the data flow of the function. Instead of returning a pre-defined variable like 'm_distance', I have written a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns their sum divided by the length of the array. The function does not check for the emptiness of the object.

Modified Function 2: (Control flow changed)
```
public double getDistance() {
  try {
    if (isEmpty())
      throw new GeometryException("invalid call");

    return m_distance;
  } catch(Exception e) {
    return 0.0;
  }
}
```
Explanation: The original function throws an exception if the object is empty. In the modified function, I have changed the control flow of the function to handle the exception. I have used a try-catch block to catch the exception thrown by the function. Instead of throwing an exception, the function now returns 0.0, if the object is empty.

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in <DATA> </DATA> tags and control flow mutated function in <CONTROL> </CONTROL> tags.**

## Response

Modified Function 1: (Data flow changed)
```
<DATA>
public double getDistance(int[] data) {
  int sum = 0;
  for(int i=0; i<data.length; i++) {
    sum += data[i];
  }
  return sum/data.length;
}
</DATA>
```

Modified Function 2: (Control flow changed)
```
<CONTROL>
public double getDistance() {
  try {
    if (isEmpty())
      throw new GeometryException("invalid call");

    return m_distance;
  } catch(Exception e) {
    return 0.0;
  }
}
</CONTROL>
```

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three combination of m_distance, isEmpty() and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```


public double getDistance() {
  try {
    if (isEmpty())
      throw new GeometryException("invalid call");

    return m_distance;
  } catch(Exception e) {
    return 0.0;
  }
}


```

## Response

| m_distance | isEmpty() | Output      | Reason                                                       |
|------------|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10.0       | false     | 10.0        | Since isEmpty() is false, the function returns m_distance 10.0 |
| 5.5        | true     | 0.0         | Since isEmpty() is true, it catches the GeometryException and returns 0.0 due to the try-catch block |
| null       | true     | 0.0         | Since isEmpty() is true, it catches the GeometryException and returns 0.0 due to the try-catch block |

The java function `getDistance()` checks if a variable `m_distance` is empty and returns a double value. If the variable is empty, it throws an exception, otherwise, it returns the value of `m_distance`. If an exception is thrown in the try block, it's caught and the function returns 0.0. 

The first combination of `m_distance = 10.0` and `isEmpty()` is false, hence it returns the value of `m_distance` which is 10.0. In the second and third combinations of `m_distance = 5.5` and `null` respectively and since `isEmpty()` is true in both cases, it catches the GeometryException exception, and returns 0.0.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. When `m_distance = 10.0` and `isEmpty()` returns false:

```
if (isEmpty()) //since isEmpty() is false in this scenario, we skip the if statement
    throw new GeometryException("invalid call");

return m_distance; //returns the value of m_distance which is 10.0
```

Therefore, the output in this case would be `10.0`.

2. When `m_distance = 5.5` and `isEmpty()` returns true:

```
if (isEmpty()) //since isEmpty() is true in this scenario, the if statement throws a GeometryException exception
    throw new GeometryException("invalid call");

return m_distance; //this statement is skipped

} catch(Exception e) {
    return 0.0; //the exception is caught and 0.0 is returned
}
```

Therefore, the output in this case would be `0.0`.

3. When `m_distance = null` and `isEmpty()` returns true:

```
if (isEmpty()) //since isEmpty() is true in this scenario, the if statement throws a GeometryException exception
    throw new GeometryException("invalid call");

return m_distance; //this statement is skipped

} catch(Exception e) {
    return 0.0; //the exception is caught and 0.0 is returned
}
```

Therefore, the output in this case would be `0.0`.

## Response

Table:

| m_distance | isEmpty() | output                                             | Reason                                                                         |
|------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| null       | true      | Throws NullPointerException                        | The function requires an input array and cannot handle null                            |
| empty      | true      | Throws ArithmeticException (division by zero)      | The function tries to divide by zero as the array has length 0                                                     |
| non-empty  | false     | The average value of the array                      | The function will compute the sum of all the values in the array and divide it by the length of the array to find the average |

Explanation:

1. When m_distance is null and isEmpty() is true, the function will throw a NullPointerException because the input array is required for the function to execute and a null array cannot be handled.

2. When the m_distance is empty and isEmpty() is true, the function will throw an ArithmeticException because the division operation will try to divide by 0, as the length of the array is 0.

3. When m_distance is non-empty and isEmpty() is false, the function will compute the sum of all the values in the array and divide it by the length of the array to find the average value. It will return the computed value as the output.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. When m_distance is null and isEmpty() is true, the function will throw a NullPointerException because the input array is required for the function to execute and a null array cannot be handled. The error message will point to the line of code where the error occurred, which is in the for loop that iterates over the array to calculate the sum.

2. When the m_distance is empty and isEmpty() is true, the function will throw an ArithmeticException because the division operation will try to divide by 0, as the length of the array is 0. The error message will point to the line of code where the division operation occurs, which is the return statement of the function.

3. When m_distance is non-empty and isEmpty() is false, the function will compute the sum of all the values in the array and divide it by the length of the array to find the average value. It will return the computed value as the output. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4], the sum of the array would be 10 and the length of the array would be 4. So, the average value would be 10/4 = 2.5. The function will then return the output value of 2.5. The calculation and execution will happen smoothly and there will be no error messages.
