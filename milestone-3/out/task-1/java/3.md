# Task 1: Data Control

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

double scal(GraphicPoint pt1, GraphicPoint pt2, GraphicPoint pt3,
			GraphicPoint pt4) {
		return (pt2.x - pt1.x) * (pt4.x - pt3.x) + (pt2.y - pt1.y)
				* (pt4.y - pt3.y);
	}

```

## Response

Here are the two revised versions of the given code:

#### Revised version 1 (data flow change):
```java
//code with changed data flow
double scalVersion1(GraphicPoint pt1, GraphicPoint pt2, GraphicPoint pt3, GraphicPoint pt4) {
    double val1 = pt2.x - pt1.x;
    double val2 = pt4.x - pt3.x;
    double val3 = pt2.y - pt1.y;
    double val4 = pt4.y - pt3.y;
    return val1 * val2 + val3 * val4;
}
```
The revised function evaluates the expressions pt2.x - pt1.x, pt4.x - pt3.x, pt2.y - pt1.y, and pt4.y - pt3.y and stores them in variables to avoid redundancy.

#### Revised version 2 (control flow change):
```java
//code with changed control flow
double scalVersion2(GraphicPoint pt1, GraphicPoint pt2, GraphicPoint pt3, GraphicPoint pt4) {
    double res = 0.0;
    if (pt2.x - pt1.x == pt4.x - pt3.x) {
        res = (pt2.x - pt1.x) * (pt4.x - pt3.x);
    } else if (pt2.y - pt1.y == pt4.y - pt3.y) {
        res = (pt2.y - pt1.y) * (pt4.y - pt3.y);
    } else {
        res = (pt2.x - pt1.x) * (pt4.x - pt3.x) + (pt2.y - pt1.y) * (pt4.y - pt3.y);
    }
    return res;
}
```
The revised function has an if-else statement that checks if the "x"-values or "y"-values of the input points are equal to each other. If any of the two "x"-values are equal to each other, the function returns the product of the two "x"-values. Similarly, if any of the two "y"-values are equal to each other, the function returns the product of the two "y"-values. Otherwise, the function returns the result of the original calculation. Essentially, this version of the function takes a shortcut in calculation whenever possible depending on the input points.

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in <DATA> </DATA> tags and control flow mutated function in <CONTROL> </CONTROL> tags.**

## Response

Sure! Here are the revised functions with the requested tags:

#### <DATA> tag for the data flow-mutated function:

```java
//<DATA>
double scalVersion1(GraphicPoint pt1, GraphicPoint pt2, GraphicPoint pt3, GraphicPoint pt4) {
    double val1 = pt2.x - pt1.x;
    double val2 = pt4.x - pt3.x;
    double val3 = pt2.y - pt1.y;
    double val4 = pt4.y - pt3.y;
    return val1 * val2 + val3 * val4;
}
//</DATA>
```

#### <CONTROL> tag for the control flow-mutated function:

```java
//<CONTROL>
double scalVersion2(GraphicPoint pt1, GraphicPoint pt2, GraphicPoint pt3, GraphicPoint pt4) {
    double res = 0.0;
    if (pt2.x - pt1.x == pt4.x - pt3.x) {
        res = (pt2.x - pt1.x) * (pt4.x - pt3.x);
    } else if (pt2.y - pt1.y == pt4.y - pt3.y) {
        res = (pt2.y - pt1.y) * (pt4.y - pt3.y);
    } else {
        res = (pt2.x - pt1.x) * (pt4.x - pt3.x) + (pt2.y - pt1.y) * (pt4.y - pt3.y);
    }
    return res;
}
//</CONTROL>
```

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```

        res = (pt2.x - pt1.x) * (pt4.x - pt3.x);
    } else if (pt2.y - pt1.y == pt4.y - pt3.y) {
        res = (pt2.y - pt1.y) * (pt4.y - pt3.y);
    } else {
        res = (pt2.x - pt1.x) * (pt4.x - pt3.x) + (pt2.y - pt1.y) * (pt4.y - pt3.y);

## Response

Table:

| Input                             | Output                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| pt1(0,0), pt2(2,0), pt3(0,2), pt4(2,2)    | 0.0 |
| pt1(1,1), pt2(4,3), pt3(1,4), pt4(4,6)    | 6.0 |
| pt1(-2,-2), pt2(-2,3), pt3(-4,-4), pt4(0,0) | 20.0 |

Explanation:
- The function takes four arguments of type GraphicPoint i.e., pt1, pt2, pt3, pt4.
- For each set of points, the function returns a double value as a result.
- In the first input, the difference between x coordinates of pt2 and pt1 is equal to the difference between the x coordinates of pt4 and pt3. So, the function will calculate res as (2 - 0) * (2 - 0) = 4.0.
- In the second input, the difference between x coordinates of pt2 and pt1 is not equal to the difference between the x coordinates of pt4 and pt3 and the difference between y coordinates of pt2 and pt1 is also not equal to the difference between y coordinates of pt4 and pt3. Therefore, the function will calculate res as (4 - 1) * (4 - 3) + (3 - 1) * (6 - 4) = 6.0.
- In the third input, the difference between x coordinates of pt2 and pt1 is not equal to the difference between the x coordinates of pt4 and pt3 but the difference between y coordinates of pt2 and pt1 is equal to the difference between y coordinates of pt4 and pt3. Therefore, the function will calculate res as ( -2 - ( -2 ) ) * (0 - ( -4 ) ) = 20.0.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. pt1(0,0), pt2(2,0), pt3(0,2), pt4(2,2)  => output: 0.0
- The difference between the x-coordinate of pt2 and pt1 is (2-0)=2.
- The difference between the x-coordinate of pt4 and pt3 is (2-0)=2.
- Since the difference between the x-coordinates of both pairs of points is equal, the function will execute the first condition and assign res = 2 * 2 = 4.0. 
- However, the next line updates the value of res to 0.0 since this condition evaluates to false.
- Finally, the function returns 0.0 as output.
 
2. pt1(1,1), pt2(4,3), pt3(1,4), pt4(4,6)  => output: 6.0
- The difference between the x-coordinate of pt2 and pt1 is (4 - 1) = 3.
- The difference between the x-coordinate of pt4 and pt3 is (4 - 1) = 3.
- The difference between the y-coordinate of pt2 and pt1 is (3 - 1) = 2.
- The difference between the y-coordinate of pt4 and pt3 is (6 - 4) = 2.
- Since neither the x-coordinate difference nor the y-coordinate difference is equal between the two pairs of points, the function will execute the else condition.
- The value of res will be calculated as (4 - 1) * (4 - 3) + (3 - 1) * (6 - 4) = 3 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 6.0
- The function returns 6.0.

3. pt1(-2,-2), pt2(-2,3), pt3(-4,-4), pt4(0,0) => output: 20.0
- The difference between the x-coordinate of pt2 and pt1 is (-2 - (-2)) = 0.
- The difference between the x-coordinate of pt4 and pt3 is (0 - (-4)) = 4.
- The difference between the y-coordinate of pt2 and pt1 is (3 - (-2)) = 5.
- The difference between the y-coordinate of pt4 and pt3 is (0 - (-4)) = 4.
- Since only the y-coordinate difference is equal between the two pairs of points, the function will execute the third condition.
- The value of res will be calculated as (-2 - (-2)) * (0 - (-4)) + (3 - (-2)) * (0 - (-4)) = 4 * 4 + 5 * 4 = 20.0
- The function returns 20.0.

    return val1 * val2 + val3 * val4;
}
//

```

## Response

Inputs:

Assuming the following values for the GraphicPoint objects: 
pt1 = (1, 3)
pt2 = (2, 4)
pt3 = (4, 6)
pt4 = (3, 5)

Outputs:

1. If we call scalVersion1(pt1, pt2, pt3, pt4):
    - val1 = 2 - 1 = 1
    - val2 = 3 - 4 = -1
    - val3 = 4 - 3 = 1
    - val4 = 5 - 6 = -1
    - The function returns 1 * (-1) + 1 * (-1) = -2

2. If we call scalVersion1(pt2, pt3, pt1, pt4):
    - val1 = 4 - 2 = 2
    - val2 = 3 - 4 = -1
    - val3 = 6 - 4 = 2
    - val4 = 5 - 5 = 0
    - The function returns 2 * (-1) + 2 * 0 = -2

3. If we call scalVersion1(pt4, pt1, pt3, pt2):
    - val1 = 1 - 3 = -2
    - val2 = 2 - 4 = -2
    - val3 = 4 - 3 = 1
    - val4 = 5 - 6 = -1
    - The function returns (-2) * (-2) + 1 * (-1) = 5

Execution:

1. The function takes 4 GraphicPoint objects as input: pt1, pt2, pt3, and pt4.
2. It calculates the difference between the x coordinates of pt2 and pt1, and assigns it to val1.
3. It calculates the difference between the x coordinates of pt4 and pt3, and assigns it to val2.
4. It calculates the difference between the y coordinates of pt2 and pt1, and assigns it to val3.
5. It calculates the difference between the y coordinates of pt4 and pt3, and assigns it to val4.
6. It returns the dot product between the vectors represented by the (val1, val3) and (val2, val4).
7. The execution of the function is complete.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. We call scalVersion1(pt1, pt2, pt3, pt4):
    - val1 = pt2.x - pt1.x = 2 - 1 = 1
    - val2 = pt4.x - pt3.x = 3 - 4 = -1
    - val3 = pt2.y - pt1.y = 4 - 3 = 1
    - val4 = pt4.y - pt3.y = 5 - 6 = -1
    - The function returns val1 * val2 + val3 * val4 = 1 * (-1) + 1 * (-1) = -2
    - Therefore, the output is -2.
    - This is because the dot product of vectors (1, 1) and (-1, -1) is -2.

2. We call scalVersion1(pt2, pt3, pt1, pt4):
    - val1 = pt3.x - pt2.x = 4 - 2 = 2
    - val2 = pt4.x - pt1.x = 3 - 1 = 2
    - val3 = pt3.y - pt2.y = 6 - 4 = 2
    - val4 = pt4.y - pt1.y = 5 - 3 = 2
    - The function returns val1 * val2 + val3 * val4 = 2 * 2 + 2 * 0 = 4
    - Therefore, the output is 4.
    - This is because the dot product of vectors (2, 2) and (2, 0) is 4.

3. We call scalVersion1(pt4, pt1, pt3, pt2):
    - val1 = pt1.x - pt4.x = 1 - 3 = -2
    - val2 = pt2.x - pt3.x = 2 - 4 = -2
    - val3 = pt1.y - pt4.y = 3 - 5 = -2
    - val4 = pt2.y - pt3.y = 4 - 6 = -2
    - The function returns val1 * val2 + val3 * val4 = (-2) * (-2) + (-2) * (-1) = 5
    - Therefore, the output is 5.
    - This is because the dot product of vectors (-2, -2) and (-2, -1) is 5.

# Observations
1. For the function with changed Control Flow - first of all the ChatGPT changes the semantics in 
generating this variant. The reasoning of the variant is incorrect as it gets confused in `else if` 
as another `if` conditions.
2. For the function with changed Data Flow, the semantics are preserved. The mathematical
calculation is incorrect. The reasoning is correct in this case.
