Explanation:

This is a function that calculates the number of vertices 'N' required to densify a line or curve. There are three input variables, namely, m_densify_dist, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle, and m_abs_distance_reversed.

The function first calculates the value of 'r' as the product of m_densify_dist and the absolute value of m_abs_distance_reversed.

If m_densify_dist is not equal to zero, it calculates the value of 'cos_a' as 1 minus 'r'.

If cos_a is less than -1, it sets N to 6. Otherwise, it calculates N as 4 times Pi divided by acos(cos_a) plus 0.5.

It then checks whether N is less than 5 and sets it to 5 if it is. It also checks whether N is greater than m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle and sets it to m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle if it is.

If m_densify_dist is equal to 0, it simply returns m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle.

In the first combination, m_densify_dist is 0.1, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle is 10, and m_abs_distance_reversed is 2. The output is 10.

In the second combination, m_densify_dist is 0.01, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle is 8, and m_abs_distance_reversed is 3. The output is 18.

In the third combination, m_densify_dist is 0, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle is 12, and m_abs_distance_reversed is -1. The output is 12.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

For the first combination, m_densify_dist is 0.1, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle is 10, and m_abs_distance_reversed is 2. The output is 10.

The value of 'r' is calculated as (0.1 * 2) = 0.2.

The value of 'cos_a' is calculated as (1-0.2) = 0.8.

N is calculated as (4 * Pi / acos(0.8)) + 0.5 = 10.327.

Since N is greater than m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle, N is set to m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle, i.e., 10.

Therefore, the output of the function for the first combination is 10.

For the second combination, m_densify_dist is 0.01, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle is 8, and m_abs_distance_reversed is 3. The output is 18.

The value of 'r' is calculated as (0.01 * 3) = 0.03.

The value of 'cos_a' is calculated as (1-0.03) = 0.97.

N is calculated as (4 * Pi / acos(0.97)) + 0.5 = 18.514.

Since N is greater than m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle, N is set to m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle, i.e., 8.

Therefore, the output of the function for the second combination is 8.

For the third combination, m_densify_dist is 0, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle is 12, and m_abs_distance_reversed is -1. The output is 12.

Since m_densify_dist is 0, the function returns m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle, i.e., 12.

Therefore, the output of the function for the third combination is 12. 

In all three combinations of inputs, the function executes a simple mathematical operation to calculate 'r' and then calculates the value of 'cos_a'. Based on the value of 'cos_a', it calculates the value of 'N', which is the number of vertices required to densify a line or curve. Finally, it checks the range of 'N' and returns the appropriate value.

To write three combinations of m_densify_dist, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle, m_abs_distance_reversed, and outputs in a table, we can assume:

The function calculates the number of vertices for a circle polygon based on given values of m_densify_dist, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle, m_abs_distance_reversed. At first, it calculates the radius 'r' of the circle polygon using the formula, r = m_densify_dist * Math.abs(m_abs_distance_reversed) * 2. Then, it calculates the cosine of half the angle 'a', which is the maximum angle between two consecutive vertices of the polygon, using the formula, cos_a = 1 - r. If the value of cos_a is less than -1, then the number of vertices 'N' is set to minN + 2. Otherwise, N is calculated using the formula, N = 2.0 * Math.PI / Math.acos(cos_a) + 0.5. If N is less than minN * 2, then N is set to minN. If N is greater than m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle * 2, then N is set to m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle. Finally, the function returns the integer value of N.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

- Combination 1:
  - m_densify_dist = 5
  - m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 20
  - m_abs_distance_reversed = 0.5
  - Output = 10

    The function calculates the number of vertices for a circle polygon using the given values of m_densify_dist, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle, m_abs_distance_reversed as follows:
   
    - r = m_densify_dist * Math.abs(m_abs_distance_reversed) * 2 = 5 * 0.5 * 2 = 5
    - cos_a = 1 - r = 1 - 5 = -4

    Since cos_a is less than -1, the value of N is set to minN + 2 i.e. 4 + 2 = 6. 

    - N = 6 

    However, N is less than minN * 2, which is 4 * 2 = 8, so the value of N is set to minN, which is 4.
    
    - N = 4

    Finally, the function returns the integer value of N, which is 4.

    Therefore, for this input combination, the function returns 4.

- Combination 2:
  - m_densify_dist = 10
  - m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 20
  - m_abs_distance_reversed = 0.5
  - Output = 20

    The function calculates the number of vertices for a circle polygon using the given values of m_densify_dist, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle, m_abs_distance_reversed as follows:
   
    - r = m_densify_dist * Math.abs(m_abs_distance_reversed) * 2 = 10 * 0.5 * 2 = 10
    - cos_a = 1 - r = 1 - 10 = -9

    Since cos_a is less than -1, the value of N is set to minN + 2 i.e. 4 + 2 = 6. 

    - N = 6 

    However, N is less than minN * 2, which is 4 * 2 = 8, so the value of N is set to minN, which is 4.
    
    - N = 4

    Finally, the function returns the integer value of N, which is 4.

    Therefore, for this input combination, the function returns 4.

- Combination 3:
  - m_densify_dist = 5
  - m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle = 10
  - m_abs_distance_reversed = 0.5
  - Output = 8

    The function calculates the number of vertices for a circle polygon using the given values of m_densify_dist, m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle, m_abs_distance_reversed as follows:
   
    - r = m_densify_dist * Math.abs(m_abs_distance_reversed) * 2 = 5 * 0.5 * 2 = 5
    - cos_a = 1 - r = 1 - 5 = -4

    Since cos_a is less than -1, the value of N is set to minN + 2 i.e. 4 + 2 = 6. 

    - N = 6 

    Since N is greater than minN * 2, which is 4 * 2 = 8, and less than m_max_vertex_in_complete_circle * 2, which is 10 * 2 = 20, the value of N is set to 8.
    
    - N = 8

    Finally, the function returns the integer value of N, which is 8.

    Therefore, for this input combination, the function returns 8.
