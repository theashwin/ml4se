# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

  public static String extension(String path)
  {
    String name = name(path);
    int extIndex = name.lastIndexOf(EXTENSION_SEPARATOR.charAt(0));
    if (extIndex < 0) return "";
    return name.substring(extIndex, name.length());
  }

```

## Response

First version - Changing the data flow:

```
public static String extension(String path)
{
    int extIndex = path.lastIndexOf(EXTENSION_SEPARATOR.charAt(0));
    
    if (extIndex < 0) return "";

    String name = path.substring(extIndex, path.length());

    return name;
}
```

Second version - Changing the control flow:

```
 // Returns the extension from a path
public static String extension(String path)
{
    String name = "";
    try {
        name = name(path);
        int extIndex = name.lastIndexOf(EXTENSION_SEPARATOR.charAt(0));
        if (extIndex < 0)
            throw new RuntimeException("No extension found for the given path");
        name = name.substring(extIndex, name.length());
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle exception
    }
    finally {
        // Perform cleanup
    }

    return name;
}
``` 

Note: In the second version, we added a try-catch block to handle an exception and a finally block to perform some cleanup. It is important to keep in mind that the semantics of the function may not be the same.

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in <DATA> </DATA> tags and control flow mutated function in <CONTROL> </CONTROL> tags.**

## Response

Here are the enclosed data flow and control flow mutated functions:

<DATA>

```
public static String extension(String path)
{
    int extIndex = path.lastIndexOf(EXTENSION_SEPARATOR.charAt(0));
    
    if (extIndex < 0) return "";

    String name = path.substring(extIndex, path.length());

    return name;
}
```

</DATA>

<CONTROL>

``` 
// Returns the extension from a path
public static String extension(String path)
{
    String name = "";
    try {
        name = name(path);
        int extIndex = name.lastIndexOf(EXTENSION_SEPARATOR.charAt(0));
        if (extIndex < 0)
            throw new RuntimeException("No extension found for the given path");
        name = name.substring(extIndex, name.length());
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle exception
    }
    finally {
        // Perform cleanup
    }

    return name;
}
``` 

</CONTROL>

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```



``` 
// Returns the extension from a path
public static String extension(String path)
{
    String name = "";
    try {
        name = name(path);
        int extIndex = name.lastIndexOf(EXTENSION_SEPARATOR.charAt(0));
        if (extIndex < 0)
            throw new RuntimeException("No extension found for the given path");
        name = name.substring(extIndex, name.length());
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle exception
    }
    finally {
        // Perform cleanup
    }

    return name;
}
``` 



```

## Response

Table:

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| "file.txt" | ".txt" |
| "path/to/my/file.docx" | ".docx" |
| "file" | RuntimeException: No extension found for the given path |

Execution:

1. The function accepts a path string as input.
2. It initializes a variable 'name' as an empty string.
3. It tries to execute a function 'name(path)' and stores its return value in 'name'.
4. It finds the index of the last occurrence of the extension separator character '.' in the name variable.
5. If the index is less than 0, it means there is no extension present in the given path, and a RuntimeException is thrown.
6. If the index is present, it extracts the substring starting from the extension separator till the end of the 'name' string.
7. It returns the extracted extension.
8. If any Exception is caught in the try block, it is handled in the catch block.
9. In the finally block, any cleanup operations are performed.
10. The output is returned.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Input 1: "file.txt"

1. The "extension" method receives the input string "file.txt".

2. It initializes a variable 'name' as an empty string.

3. The function now calls the method `name("file.txt")`. The `name` function is assumed to work properly, it will simply extract the filename from the given path string, and it returns "file.txt".

     `name("file.txt") = "file.txt"`

4. The `lastIndexOf()` method is called on the string "file.txt" to find the last occurrence of '.' in this string. The index of '.' is found to be 4.

     `lastIndexOf(".") = 4`

5. As the index is greater than or equal to 0, the substring of length 4 from index 4 (including the dot) till the end of 'name' is extracted. The extracted substring is ".txt".

     `name.substring(4, 8) = ".txt"`

6. The extracted extension is returned as ".txt".

     output = ".txt"


Input 2: "path/to/my/file.docx"

1. The "extension" method receives the input string "path/to/my/file.docx".

2. It initializes a variable 'name' as an empty string.

3. The function now calls the method `name("path/to/my/file.docx")`. The `name` function is assumed to work properly, it will simply extract the filename from the given path string, and it returns "file.docx".

     `name("path/to/my/file.docx") = "file.docx"`

4. The `lastIndexOf()` method is called on the string "file.docx" to find the last occurrence of '.' in this string. The index of '.' is found to be 4.

     `lastIndexOf(".") = 8`

5. As the index is greater than or equal to 0, the substring of length 5 from index 8 (including the dot) till the end of 'name' is extracted. The extracted substring is ".docx".

     `name.substring(8, 13) = ".docx"`

6. The extracted extension is returned as ".docx".

     output = ".docx"


Input 3: "file"

1. The "extension" method receives the input string "file".

2. It initializes a variable 'name' as an empty string.

3. The function now calls the method `name("file")`. The `name` function is assumed to work properly, it will simply extract the filename from the given path string, and it returns "file".

     `name("file") = "file"`

4. The `lastIndexOf()` method is called on the string "file" to find the last occurrence of '.' in this string. There is no occurrence of '.' in the string "file".

     `lastIndexOf(".") = -1`

5. As the index is less than 0, a RuntimeException is thrown with the message "No extension found for the given path".

6. The exception is caught in the catch block and handled appropriately.

7. Any cleanup operations are performed in the finally block.

8. As a RuntimeException is thrown in step 5, no output is returned.

## Response

| Input              | Output | Explanation                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "image.jpeg"       | ".jpeg"| In this case, the input `path` has an extension separator (.) at `extIndex = 5`. The `name` variable gets assigned the string ".jpeg"|
| "file.with.multiple.dots.doc" | ".doc" | In this case, the input `path` has multiple extension separators. The function will return the string after the last separator (".doc") |
| "no_extension"     | ""| In this case, the input `path` does not contain an extension separator. Therefore, the function will return an empty string as specified in the return statement |

Explanation of the function: 

1. The input `path` is a string that represents a file or directory path.
2. The function finds the index of the last occurrence of the extension separator symbol (".") in the path string using the `lastIndexOf` method.
3. If the `extIndex` is less than zero (i.e., not found), an empty string is returned.
4. If the extension separator is found, the substring of the input path from the `extIndex` to the end of the `path` is extracted and returned as the extension.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

**Input: "image.jpeg"**

1. The function is called with `path` variable equal to `"image.jpeg"`.
2. The `lastIndexOf` method returns the index of the last instance of the separator character in the `path` variable, which is 5.
3. The `name` variable is then assigned the value of the `substring` of the `path` variable between index 5 and the end of the string. This results in the `name` variable containing the value ".jpeg".
4. The `name` variable is then returned from the function as output.

Hence the output is ".jpeg". 

**Input: "file.with.multiple.dots.doc"**

1. The function is called with `path` variable equal to "file.with.multiple.dots.doc".
2. The `lastIndexOf` method returns the index of the last instance of the separator character in the `path` variable, which is 22.
3. The `name` variable is then assigned the value of the `substring` of the `path` variable between index 22 and the end of the string. This results in the `name` variable containing the value ".doc".
4. The `name` variable is then returned from the function as output.

Hence the output is ".doc".

**Input: "no_extension"**

1. The function is called with `path` variable equal to "no_extension".
2. The `lastIndexOf` method returns -1 since the input string has no extension separator. 
3. The function then returns an empty string as specified in the `return` statement. 

Hence the output is "".
