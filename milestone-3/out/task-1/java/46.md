# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```
public static LinkedHashSet<String> yearAndQuarter(long startDate, long endDate) {
    LinkedHashSet<String> quarters = new LinkedHashSet<>();
    final Calendar cal = calendar(startDate);
    while (startDate <= endDate) {
        // 如果开始时间超出结束时间，让结束时间为开始时间，处理完后结束循环
        quarters.add(yearAndQuarter(cal));

        cal.add(Calendar.MONTH, 3);
        startDate = cal.getTimeInMillis();
    }

    return quarters;
}
```

## Response

First version of the function:

This version of the function changes the data flow by using streams and lambdas to process the date range and generate the set of year and quarter values.

```
public static LinkedHashSet<String> yearAndQuarter(long startDate, long endDate) {
    return LongStream.rangeClosed(startDate, endDate)
        .mapToObj(date -> yearAndQuarter(calendar(date)))
        .collect(Collectors.toCollection(LinkedHashSet::new));
}
```

Second version of the function:

This version of the function changes the control flow by using a do-while loop instead of a while loop.
```java
public static LinkedHashSet<String> yearAndQuarter(long startDate, long endDate) {
    LinkedHashSet<String> quarters = new LinkedHashSet<>();
    final Calendar cal = calendar(startDate);

    do {
        quarters.add(yearAndQuarter(cal));
        cal.add(Calendar.MONTH, 3);
    } while (cal.getTimeInMillis() <= endDate);

    return quarters;
}
```

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in <DATA> </DATA> tags and control flow mutated function in <CONTROL> </CONTROL> tags.**

## Response
<DATA>
public static LinkedHashSet<String> yearAndQuarter(long startDate, long endDate) {
    LinkedHashSet<String> quarters = new LinkedHashSet<>();
    final Calendar cal = calendar(startDate);
    while (startDate <= endDate) {
        // 如果开始时间超出结束时间，让结束时间为开始时间，处理完后结束循环
        String yearQuarter = yearAndQuarter(cal);
        if (!quarters.contains(yearQuarter)) {
            quarters.add(yearQuarter);
        }
        cal.add(Calendar.MONTH, 3);
        startDate = cal.getTimeInMillis();
    }

}

## Prompt

**For the java function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**
```java
public static LinkedHashSet<String> yearAndQuarter(long startDate, long endDate) {
    LinkedHashSet<String> quarters = new LinkedHashSet<>();
    final Calendar cal = calendar(startDate);
    do {
        quarters.add(yearAndQuarter(cal));
        cal.add(Calendar.MONTH, 3);
    } while (cal.getTimeInMillis() <= endDate);
	return quarters;
}
```

## Response

Inputs and outputs table:

| Input | output                                   |
|----|------------------------------------------|
| 2021-01-01, 2021-03-31	| {"2021Q1"}                               |
| 2020-01-01, 2020-12-31	  | {"2020Q1", "2020Q2", "2020Q3", "2020Q4"} |
| 2022-06-01, 2022-09-30	  | {"2022Q3"}                               |
                            
The function takes a string as input, representing a date or time value in different formats. It then applies various pattern-matching checks to identify the format of the input string and parse it into a DateTime object. The function first trims the input string and removes the Chinese character "日" to standardize the length of the input string. It then checks the length of the input string and matches it against pre-defined format patterns to determine the format of the input string. If the input string matches a pre-defined pattern, the function uses the corresponding parsing method to create a DateTime object. If the input string does not match any pre-defined patterns, the function throws a DateException with an appropriate error message.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Input 1: startDate = 1620556800000 (May 10, 2021), endDate = 1640995200000 (Dec 31, 2021)

1. Initialize quarters to an empty LinkedHashSet<String> and cal to the Calendar instance representing startDate.
2. Add the yearAndQuarter(cal) (which is "2021-Q2") to quarters.
3. Add 3 months to cal.
4. Check if the current time in milliseconds of cal (cal.getTimeInMillis()) is less than or equal to endDate (1640995200000). Since it is less than or equal to endDate, go back to step 2.
5. Add the yearAndQuarter(cal) (which is "2021-Q3") to quarters.
6. Add 3 months to cal.
7. Check if the current time in milliseconds of cal is less than or equal to endDate. Since it is less than or equal to endDate, go back to step 2.
8. Add the yearAndQuarter(cal) (which is "2021-Q4") to quarters.
9. Add 3 months to cal.
10. Check if the current time in milliseconds of cal is less than or equal to endDate. Since it is greater than endDate, exit the loop.
11. Return quarters.

Execution of the function is straightforward. It starts by adding the quarter of the first month to the output set, then adds quarters for every subsequent third month until the end date is reached. The output in this case is a set of three strings representing the quarters in the range May 10, 2021 to December 31, 2021.

Input 2: startDate = 1640995200000 (Dec 31, 2021), endDate = 1643647200000 (Jan 31, 2022)

1. Initialize quarters to an empty LinkedHashSet<String> and cal to the Calendar instance representing startDate.
2. Add the yearAndQuarter(cal) (which is "2022-Q1") to quarters.
3. Add 3 months to cal.
4. Check if the current time in milliseconds of cal (cal.getTimeInMillis()) is less than or equal to endDate (1643647200000). Since it is greater than endDate, exit the loop.
5. Return quarters.

Execution of the function is similar to Input 1. However, since the start and end dates are only one month apart, the function only returns the quarter for the start date, which is "2022-Q1".

Input 3: startDate = 1654060800000 (May 31, 2022), endDate = 1622505600000 (May 31, 2021)

1. Initialize quarters to an empty LinkedHashSet<String> and cal to the Calendar instance representing startDate.
2. Since startDate is greater than endDate, the loop is not executed.
3. Return quarters.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Input 1: startDate = 1620748800000, endDate = 1640995200000

- The function initializes an empty LinkedHashSet called quarters.
- It creates a Calendar object cal based on the given startDate.
- The while loop iterates until startDate is greater than endDate.
- On the first iteration, the yearAndQuarter method is called with cal as an argument, which returns "2022-Q2". This value is added to quarters.
- cal is then incremented by 3 months using cal.add(Calendar.MONTH, 3).
- The value of startDate is updated to cal.getTimeInMillis(), which is now 1651401600000 (i.e., startDate is set to the next quarter start time).
- The while loop condition is checked again and it fails, so the loop terminates.
- The final value of quarters is {"2022-Q2", "2022-Q3", "2022-Q4", "2023-Q1"}.

Input 2: startDate = 1559347200000, endDate = 1580496000000

- cal is then incremented by 3 months using cal.add(Calendar.MONTH, 3).
- The value of startDate is updated to cal.getTimeInMillis(), which is now 1569888000000 (i.e., startDate is set to the next quarter start time).
- On the second iteration, the yearAndQuarter method is called with cal as an argument, which returns "2019-Q4". This value is added to quarters.
- cal is then incremented by 3 months using cal.add(Calendar.MONTH, 3).
- The value of startDate is updated to cal.getTimeInMillis(), which is now 1577836800000 (i.e., startDate is set to the next quarter start time).
- The while loop condition is checked again and it fails, so the loop terminates.
- The final value of quarters is {"2019-Q3", "2019-Q4"}.
