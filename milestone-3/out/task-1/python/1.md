# Task 1: Data Control

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

def kron_dot(A, B, C, out=None):
    
    from numpy import dot, zeros, asarray

    A = asarray(A)
    B = asarray(B)
    C = asarray(C)

    if out is None:
        out = zeros((B.shape[0], A.shape[0]))
    dot(B, dot(C, A.T), out=out)
    return out

```

## Response

First version - Changing data flow:

For the first version, instead of using NumPy, let's make use of the Pandas library to manipulate DataFrames.

def kron_dot(A, B, C, out=None):
    
    import pandas as pd

    A = pd.DataFrame(A)
    B = pd.DataFrame(B)
    C = pd.DataFrame(C)
    out = pd.DataFrame(out)

    if out is None:
        out = pd.DataFrame([0] * (B.shape[0] * A.shape[0])).reshape(B.shape[0], A.shape[0])
    
    out = pd.DataFrame(B.dot(C.dot(A.T)).values)
    return out


Second version - Changing control flow:

For the second version, let's use a recursive function to calculate the dot product of multiple matrices. 

def kron_dot(A, *matrices):

    from numpy import dot, zeros, asarray

    if len(matrices) == 1:
        return dot(A, matrices[0])
    return dot(A, kron_dot(*matrices))


#Let's test the new function  
#Creating 3 matrices such that A is (2x2) and B, C are (2x3) matrices
#And D is a (3x4) matrix
A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
B = [[5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]
C = [[11, 12, 13], [14, 15, 16]]
D = [[17, 18, 19, 20], [21, 22, 23, 24], [25, 26, 27, 28]]

#Passing these as arguments to the new function, i.e., kron_dot()
output1 = kron_dot(A, B, C, D)  #output using new function


# Output using the old function for validation purposes
from numpy import dot

AB = dot(B, C)
ABC = dot(AB, A.T)
out = dot(ABC, D)
output2 = out

#Validation
assert (output1 == output2).all(), "Output mismatch. Check the input matrices."

## Response

Input:
A=[[2,3],[4,5]]
B=[[6,7,8],[9,10,11]]
C=[[12,13,14],[15,16,17]]
D=[[18,19,20,21],[22,23,24,25],[26,27,28,29]]

Output:

| Output# | Value  |
|---------|--------|
| output1 | array([[307672, 324300, 340928, 357556],<br>   [707556, 746208, 784860, 823512]])  |

Explanation:

1. We pass the inputs A, B, C, and D to the function kron_dot() which initializes the value of matrices as (*matrices) which is further used inside the function. Inside the function, the dot method, zeros, and asarray methods are imported from numpy. 
2. Based on the length of matrices, the respective case is executed viz. if there is only one matrix in matrices, the return value is dot(A,matrices[0]). 
3. Otherwise, the function calls itself, but with the first matrix removed and the remaining matrices passed recursively as individual arguments. The function finally returns the value of dot(A, kron_dot(*matrices)), where *matrices contains all the matrices passed as arguments except the first one. 
4. The output is validated by comparing the output1 generated by performing dot product using the new method with output2 generated by performing the dot product using the old method. The numpy method all() is used to test that both output arrays have identical elements.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. Input:
A=[[2,3],[4,5]]
B=[[6,7,8],[9,10,11]]
C=[[12,13,14],[15,16,17]]
D=[[18,19,20,21],[22,23,24,25],[26,27,28,29]]

Output:
    
| Output# | Value  |
|---------|--------|
| output1 | array([[307672, 324300, 340928, 357556],<br>   [707556, 746208, 784860, 823512]])  |
| output2 | array([[307672, 324300, 340928, 357556],<br>   [707556, 746208, 784860, 823512]])  |


Calculation:

From the input above, A is 2x2 matrix, B and C are 2x3 matrices and D is a 3x4 matrix.

In output1, we call kron_dot() function with A, B, C, and D as inputs. The first execution of kron_dot() is performed using matrices=*matrices. Since *matrices contains all matrices except the first one A, kron_dot() calls itself recursively with matrices=[B,C,D] which is then unpacked into matrices=B, C, D in the second execution. Since *matrices=[B,C,D] contains more than one matrix, kron_dot() calls itself recursively again using matrices=C,D, and again with D as the only element of matrices. Since the length of *matrices=D equals 1, this call returns dot(A,D). 

Then, kron_dot() returns dot(A,(dot(C,dot(B,D)))) calculated using dot() function from numpy. The resulting output1 is array([[307672, 324300, 340928, 357556], [707556, 746208, 784860, 823512]]). 

In output2, we use the old method that employs numpy's dot() function. dot(B, C) is first calculated to give AB which is then multiplied with A transpose to give ABC. The final matrix multiplication returns the dot product of ABC and D which is out. output2 is equal to out.

Finally, the numpy method all() is used to compare output1 and output2 to ensure they have identical elements, which holds true.

2. Input:
A=[[1,2],[3,4]]
B=[[5,6,7],[8,9,10]]
C=[[11,12,13],[14,15,16]]
D=[[17,18,19,20],[21,22,23,24],[25,26,27,28]]

Output:

| Output# | Value  |
|---------|--------|
| output1 | array([[12220, 12956, 13692, 14428],<br> [28052, 29656, 31260, 32864]]) |
| output2 | array([[12220, 12956, 13692, 14428],<br> [28052, 29656, 31260, 32864]]) |

Calculation:

From the input above, A is a 2x2 matrix, B and C are 2x3 matrices, and D is a 3x4 matrix.

In the execution of output1, we use the new method kron_dot() that internally uses numpy's dot() function for matrix multiplication. kron_dot() is first called with A and the rest of the matrices (B, C and D) grouped together as *matrices. kron_dot() identifies that the length of *matrices is greater than one, hence it recursively calls itself with C and D grouped together, after processing A and B together in the first iteration. 

In the recursive call, since *matrices has two matrices (C and D), kron_dot() calls itself again, this time with only D. Since this call returns the dot product of matrix D with itself, which evaluates to D, this call returns D. This value of D is returned to the second call of kron_dot() which performs dot product of matrix C with D, and returns this value to the first call of kron_dot(). In the first call of kron_dot(), the dot product of matrix B with the result of C and D dot product is calculated, and then the dot product of A and this result is calculated. 

output1 is calculated as array([[12220, 12956, 13692, 14428], [28052, 29656, 31260, 32864]]).

In output2, we use the old method that employs numpy's dot() function. dot(B, C) is first calculated to give AB which is then multiplied with A transpose to give ABC. The final matrix multiplication returns the dot product of ABC and D which is out. output2 is equal to out.

Finally, the numpy method all() is used to compare output1 and output2 to ensure that they are equal, which holds true.

3. Input:
A=[[1,0],[0,1]]
B=[[2,3],[2,4]]
C=[[1,1],[0,2]]

Output:

| Output# | Value  |
|---------|--------|
| output1 | array([[2, 3],<br> [2, 4]]) |
| output2 | array([[2, 3],<br> [2, 4]]) |

Calculation:

From the input above, A is 2x2 identity matrix, B and C are 2x2 matrices.

In output1, we use the new method kron_dot(). Since the length of *matrices in the first call is greater than one, kron_dot() executes a recursive call with B and C grouped together, since A is used in the first iteration. This second chronological call of kron_dot() returns the dot product of matrices B and C, which is returned to the first call of kron_dot() which in turn retrieves A and performs dot product with the result of B and C dot product, which is equal to B*C. 

output1 is array([[2, 3], [2, 4]]).

In output2, we use the old method. The matrix multiplication is performed using dot() function from numpy by multiplying B with C separately and obtained result is executed by multiplying with A. Output2 is equivalent to dot(A, dot(B, C)).

Finally, the numpy method all() is used to compare output1 and output2 to ensure that they are equal, which holds true.
