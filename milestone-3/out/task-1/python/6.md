# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

from numpy import asarray, copy, dot, einsum, empty, multiply
def ddot(L, R, left=None, out=None):
    L = asarray(L, float)
    R = asarray(R, float)
    if left is None:
        ok = min(L.ndim, R.ndim) == 1 and max(L.ndim, R.ndim) == 2
        if not ok:
            msg = "Wrong array layout. One array should have"
            msg += " ndim=1 and the other one ndim=2."
            raise ValueError(msg)
        left = L.ndim == 1
    if left:
        if out is None:
            out = copy(R)
        L = L.reshape(list(L.shape) + [1] * (R.ndim - 1))
        return multiply(L, R, out=out)
    else:
        if out is None:
            out = copy(L)
        return multiply(L, R, out=out)

```

## Response

One possible version changing the data flow of the function:
```python
from numpy import asarray, copy, dot, einsum, empty, multiply

def ddot_mod1(a, b, axis=None):
    a = asarray(a, float)
    b = asarray(b, float)

    if axis == 0 or axis is None:
        res = a.dot(b)
    else:
        a_flat = einsum('i...->...i', a)
        b = b.reshape([1] * (a.ndim - 1) + list(b.shape))
        res = multiply(a_flat, b, out=a_flat).sum(axis=axis)

    return res
```
In this modified function, the data flow is different because we change the way the function receives the input, using two arrays `a` and `b` instead of one `L` and one `R`. Also, we include the option to sum the output along an axis.

Another possible version changing the control flow of the function:
```python
import numpy as np

def ddot_mod2(L, R, left=None, out=None):
    L = np.asarray(L, float)
    R = np.asarray(R, float)
    if left is None:
        ok = L.ndim == R.ndim and L.shape == R.shape
        if ok:
            # when both arrays have the same shape, we can just multiply them element-wise
            return multiply(L, R, out=out)
        else:
            msg = "Arrays should have the same shape for element-wise multiplication."
            raise ValueError(msg)
        
    if left:
        if L.ndim != 1:
            msg = "Wrong array layout. The left array should have ndim=1."
            raise ValueError(msg)
        if out is None:
            out = np.empty([R.shape[1],], dtype=R.dtype)
        out[:] = dot(L, R)
        return out
    else:
        if R.ndim != 1:
            msg = "Wrong array layout. The right array should have ndim=1."
            raise ValueError(msg)
        if out is None:
            out = np.empty([L.shape[0],], dtype=L.dtype)
        out[:] = dot(L, R[:, np.newaxis])
        return out
```
In this modified function, the control flow is different because we change the way the function handles the cases when `left` is `None` or not. Also, we raise an exception when the input data is not appropriate for the desired operation (element-wise multiplication or matrix multiplication).

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. Input `ddot_mod2([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])`:
   - L and R are both 1D arrays, so `left` and `out` are not defined. 
   - `multiply(L, R, out=out)` computes the element-wise product of L and R, resulting in `array([4., 10., 18.])`.
   - This array is returned as output.
    
2. Input `ddot_mod2([1, 2, 3], [[4, 5], [6, 7], [8, 9]], left=True)`:
   - L is a 1D array, R is a 2D array with shape (3,2), so `left=True` and `out=None`.
   - The function checks if L has ndim=1. This condition is satisfied.
   - A numpy array `out` is created with shape (2,) and type float.
   - The dot product of the L and R is computed as `L[0]*R[0, :] + L[1]*R[1, :] + L[2]*R[2, :]`, resulting in array [32., 38.].
   - This array is returned as output.
   
3. Input `ddot_mod2(np.array([[1,2],[3,4]]), [5,6])`:
   - L is a 2D array with shape (2,2), R is a 1D array, so `left=None` and `out=None`.
   - The function checks if L has the same shape as R. This condition is not satisfied.
   - The function checks if R is a 1D array. This condition is satisfied.
   - A numpy array `out` is created with shape (2,) and type float.
   - The dot product of the L and R is computed as `L.dot(R[:, np.newaxis])`, resulting in array [[17.], [39.]].
   - This array is flattened to 1D using `out[:]`, resulting in array [17., 39.].
   - This array is returned as output.

To execute the given code:
- First, the function `ddot_mod1` is defined with inputs a, b, and the axis. 
- Then, arrays, `a` and `b`, are typecasted to float arrays using `asarray` function. 
- If the `axis` is either 0 or not given, then it performs regular dot product between a and b using `dot` function and assigns it to the variable `res`. Otherwise, 
    - A's shape is modified: it retains all the dimensions after the first one and flattens the first one using `einsum` function. 
    - B is reshaped to insert new axes at the beginning and then zeroes into the a.ndim - 1 number of dimensions at the beginning, using a list comprehension. 
    - The modified `a` variable after the einsum is multiplied with modified `b` using `multiply` function between them using the output of the flatten function and the reshape function, a_flat and b, and stores the output in a_flat. 
    - The `sum` is found along the given ‘axis’, which is provided as the input to the function `sum` function. 
- Finally, the output, `res`, is returned.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. For the input `a`=[(2, 3), (3, 2)] and `b`=[(3, 2), (2, 3)]:

- `a` and `b` arrays are type-casted to float using `asarray` function.
- The `axis` is not given, so it takes the default value `None`.
- The dimensions of arrays `a` and `b` are compatible for the dot product. Therefore, `dot` function computes the dot product of `a` and `b` and stores in `res` variable.
- Finally, `res` is returned.

The calculations are as follows:
- For the first pair of arrays, a, and b:
  - `a` is of shape (2, 3) and `b` is of shape (3, 2).
  - Performing a dot product between `a` and `b` matrices results in the following calculation:
    ```
    a.dot(b) => array([[ 6.,  9.],
                       [ 9.,  6.]])
    ```
  - For the second pair of arrays, c, and d:
    - `c` has the shape (2, 3) and `d` has the shape (3, 2).
  - Performing a dot product between `c` and `d` matrices results in the following calculation:
    ```
    c.dot(d) => array([[ 6.,  9.],
                       [ 9.,  6.]])
    ```
    
Therefore, the output is `array([12., 12.])`.

2. For the input `a`= [(4, 3, 2), (2, 3, 4)] and `b`= [(2, 4, 3), (3, 2, 4)], and `axis`=2:
- `a` and `b` arrays are type-casted to float using `asarray` function.
- The `axis` is given 2, so the function enters the else part.
- Using the `einsum` function, the first axis of `a` is flattened and reshaped as well which results in `a_flat` of shape `(3, 8)`.
- `b` is reshaped as  `[[[[2., 4., 3.],
             [3., 2., 4.]]],`
 
` 
            `[[[[2., 4., 3.],`
 
              `[3., 2., 4.]]]]
 /* new axes at the beginning */
             
  `[1]`*2, `[1]`*4,+`[3,2,4]` will make it of the shape `(2, 1, 1, 4, 3)`.
- `a_flat` is multiplied with the reshaped `b` using `multiply`. The result of multiplication is a tensor of shape `(3, 8, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3)`.
- The sum is taken along the given `axis=2` using the `sum` function.
- Finally, the array with shape `(2, 2)` is returned.

The calculations are as follows:
- For the first pair of arrays, `a` and `b`:
  - `a` is of shape (4, 3, 2) and `b` is of shape (2, 4, 3).
  - Since `axis=2`, the function enters into the else part.
  - Using the `einsum` function, `a` is reshaped to flatten the first axis which results in a_flat`(3, 8)`.
  - Now, calculate the new shape of `b`. Multiply `[1]`*2 and `[1]`*4 with the original shape of `b` and adding the `axis`-specified shape at last will give the new shape `(2, 1, 1, 4, 3)`.
  - Then, `b` is reshaped as a tensor of the new shape `(2, 1, 1, 4, 3)`.
  - `a_flat` is multiplied with the `b` using the `multiply` function. The result of multiplication is a tensor of shape `(3, 8, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3)`.
  - The sum is taken along axis 2 using the `sum` function, which gives an array of shape `(2, 2)`.
  - Finally, the output is `array([[138, 142], [142, 138]])`.


3. For the input `a`= [(2, 3), (3, 2)] and `b`= [(3, 2), (2, 3)] and `axis`=1:
- `a` and `b` arrays are type-casted to float using `asarray` function.
- `axis` is given 1.
- `einsum` function is used to flatten the first axis of `a`, which results in `a_flat` of shape `(3, 2)` (for the 1st element of `a`), `(2, 3)` (for the 2nd element of `a`).
- `b` is reshaped to have the shape `(1, 2, 3, 2)` and is used to multiply with `a_flat`.
- `multiply` function is performed using `a_flat`, `b`, and out parameter of a_flat to avoid creation of a new array.
- `sum` is taken along axis=1.
- Finally, the output is returned.

The calculations are as follows:
- For the first pair of arrays, `a` and `b`:
  - `a` is of shape (2, 3) and `b` is of shape (3, 2).
  - Since `axis=1`, the `einsum` function is used to flatten the first axis of `a`, which results in `a_flat` of shape `(3, 2)` (for the 1st element of `a`), `(2, 3)` (for the 2nd element of `a`).
  - `b` is reshaped to have the shape `(1, 2, 3, 2)`.
    ```
   [[[[3., 2.],
       [2., 3.],
       [4., 5.]],

      [[5., 4.],
       [4., 5.],
       [3., 2.]]]])
    ```
  - Then, the reshape `b` is used to multiply with `a_flat`.
  - `multiply` function is performed using `a_flat`, `b`, and out parameter of a_flat to avoid creation of a new array.
  - The sum is taken along axis=1, which gives an array of shape `(2, 3)`.
  - Finally, the output is `array([[4., 5., 4.], [5., 4., 5.]])`.
