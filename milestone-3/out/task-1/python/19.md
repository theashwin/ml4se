# Task 1: Data Control

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

def _norm(x0, x1):
    m = max(abs(x0), abs(x1))
    with errstate(invalid="ignore"):
        a = (x0 / m) * (x0 / m)
        b = (x1 / m) * (x1 / m)
        return nan_to_num(m * sqrt(a + b))

```

## Response

Here are the modified versions of the function:

1. Data Flow modified version:

In this modified version of the function, we will change the way data flows within the function. Instead of using maximum value to normalize the input, we will use the minimum value. We will also introduce a check to make sure that the input values are not equal to zero. If the input values are equal to zero, we will return 0. Finally, we will return the normalized value without the square root.

Code:
```
from numpy import errstate, nan_to_num

def _norm_dataflow(x0, x1):
    if x0 == 0 or x1 == 0:
        return 0
    m = min(abs(x0), abs(x1))
    with errstate(invalid="ignore"):
        a = (x0 / m) * (x0 / m)
        b = (x1 / m) * (x1 / m)
        return nan_to_num(m * (a + b))
```

2. Control Flow modified version:

In this modified version of the function, we will change the control flow of the function. Instead of using exceptions to handle invalid input, we will use conditional statements. We will also change the calculation of the normalized value by using a single line of code within a ternary operator. Finally, the function will always return a value, even if the input is invalid.

Code:
```
from numpy import nan_to_num, sqrt

def _norm_controlflow(x0, x1):
    if (x0 == 0 and x1 == 0) or (x0 == 0 or x1 == 0):
        return 0
    m = abs(x0) if abs(x0) > abs(x1) else abs(x1)
    return nan_to_num(m * sqrt((x0 / m)**2 + (x1 / m)**2))
```

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

## Response

Here are the modified functions enclosed with the requested tags:

`<DATA>` tag:

```
<DATA>
from numpy import errstate, nan_to_num

def _norm_dataflow(x0, x1):
    if x0 == 0 or x1 == 0:
        return 0
    m = min(abs(x0), abs(x1))
    with errstate(invalid="ignore"):
        a = (x0 / m) * (x0 / m)
        b = (x1 / m) * (x1 / m)
        return nan_to_num(m * (a + b))
</DATA>
```

`<CONTROL>` tag:

```
<CONTROL>
from numpy import nan_to_num, sqrt

def _norm_controlflow(x0, x1):
    if (x0 == 0 and x1 == 0) or (x0 == 0 or x1 == 0):
        return 0
    m = abs(x0) if abs(x0) > abs(x1) else abs(x1)
    return nan_to_num(m * sqrt((x0 / m)**2 + (x1 / m)**2))
</CONTROL>

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```


from numpy import nan_to_num, sqrt

def _norm_controlflow(x0, x1):
    if (x0 == 0 and x1 == 0) or (x0 == 0 or x1 == 0):
        return 0
    m = abs(x0) if abs(x0) > abs(x1) else abs(x1)
    return nan_to_num(m * sqrt((x0 / m)**2 + (x1 / m)**2))


```

## Response

Inputs:

| Input | Variable Type | Value | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------|-------------|
|`x0`   |Number (int or float)|-2.5 |The first number to be used to calculate the norm.|
|`x1`   |Number (int or float)|1.7|The second number to be used to calculate the norm.|

Outputs:

| Output | Value | Description |
|-------|------|--------|
| Return | `numpy.float64` | The norm of the two input numbers as a float, or 0 if both inputs are 0. |

Execution:

1. Check if `x0` and `x1` are both 0 or if either of them is 0. If true, return 0. Otherwise, go to step 2.
2. Define variable `m` as the larger of the absolute values of `x0` and `x1`. If `|x0| > |x1|`, `m` is assigned the value of `|x0|`, else it is assigned the value of `|x1|`.
3. Calculate the norm of `x0` and `x1` by taking their ratio and then multiplying by `m`. Assign the result to the variable `norm`.
4. Replace any NaN and infinity values in `norm` with `0` using the `nan_to_num()` function.
5. Return the resulting value of `norm`.

Note that the function relies on the `sqrt()` and `nan_to_num()` functions imported from the `numpy` library.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Input 1:
- `x0 = -2.5` 
- `x1 = 1.7`
- The absolute value of `x0` is greater than `x1` so `m = |x0| = 2.5`.
- Calculating the norm:
  - `(x0 / m)**2 = (-2.5 / 2.5)**2 = 1`
  - `(x1 / m)**2 = (1.7 / 2.5)**2 = 0.4624`
  - `norm = m * sqrt(1 + 0.4624) = 2.9832`
- Since the result is not NaN or infinity, it is returned as a numpy float: `2.983204023278863`.
  
Input 2:
- `x0 = 0` 
- `x1 = 0`
- Since both `x0` and `x1` are 0, the function will return 0.
- The result returned is a numpy float equal to `0.0`.

Input 3:
- `x0 = 2.75` 
- `x1 = 0`
- Since `x1` is 0, the function will return 0.
- The result returned is a numpy float equal to `0.0`. 
 
In each case, the function applied the control flow and mathematical operations defined. The final results were either a valid numeric value or 0, as expected.

```

## Response

| Input | Output | Reasoning |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 3, 9 | 2.592 | Since both inputs are non-zero, the function continues with min(3, 9) which is 3. x0 and x1 are divided by min(x0, x1) which is x0/3 and x1/3 (in this case). Those values are then squared and summed (x0^2 / 3^2 + x1^2 / 3^2) which results in 10/3. This value is then multiplied by the minimum between x0 and x1 which is 3 to result in (10/3)*3 = 10. Since all operations are valid, the function returns 10. |
| 0, 5 | 0 | Since one of the inputs is zero, the if statement at the beginning is satisfied, and the function returns 0. |
| -12, 7 | 7.163 | Since neither input is zero, the function continues to min(abs(-12), abs(7)) which is 7. x0 and x1 are divided by min(x0, x1) which is x1/7 and x0/7 (notice the order this time). Those values are then squared and summed ((7^2) / (7^2) + (-12^2) / (7^2)) which results in 193/49. This value is then multiplies by the minimum between x0 and x1 which is 7 to result in (193/49)*7 = 27.163. Since all operations are valid, the function returns 27.163. |

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

For Input 1: (3, 9)

- x0 and x1 are both non-zero.
- The function proceeds to find the minimum value between x0 and x1, which is 3.
- Then, x0 and x1 are divided by 3 (the minimum value). So, x0/3 = 1 and x1/3 = 3.
- These values are then squared. x0/3 squared results in 1/9 and x1/3 squared results in 1.
- Add the squares. 1/9 + 1 = 10/9.
- Multiply the sum by 3 (the minimum between x0 and x1). 10/9 * 3 = 10/3 which is approximately 2.592.
- Finally, since all operations are valid, the function returns 2.592.

For Input 2: (0, 5)

- x0 is zero. The if statement at the beginning is satisfied, thus the function returns 0.

For Input 3: (-12, 7)

- x0 and x1 are both non-zero.
- The minimum value between x0 and x1 is 7.
- Then, x1/7 = 1 and x0/7 = -12/7.
- These values are then squared. x1/7 squared results in 1 and x0/7 squared results in 144/49.
- Add the squares. 1 + 144/49 = 193/49.
- Multiply the sum by 7 (minimum between x0 and x1). 193/49 * 7 = 7.163.
- Since all operations are valid, the function returns 7.163.


## Observations

For Data Flow, GPT provides appropriate reasoning along with calculations & their meaning.
For Control Flow, Chat GPT provides semantically correct code & the reasoning is also on point.
Interesting thing to note is that chatGPT understands the variable name used in the function and more importantly what calculation it signifies.
