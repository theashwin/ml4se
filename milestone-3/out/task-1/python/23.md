# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

import numpy as np
from numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix import matrix, asmatrix
from numpy import *  

def identity(n,dtype=None):
    a = array([1]+n*[0], dtype=dtype)
    b = empty((n, n), dtype=dtype)
    b.flat = a
    return b

```

## Response

Here are two versions of the function 'identity':

1. Data Flow Changed Function:
In this version, we will change the way the function processes data and returns the output matrix. Instead of using NumPy's built-in functions to create the identity matrix, we will manually create the matrix and return it. 

```
def identity_v1(n, dtype=None):
    identity_matrix = []

    for i in range(n):
        row = []

        for j in range(n):
            if i == j:
              row.append(1)
            else:
              row.append(0)

        identity_matrix.append(row)

    return identity_matrix
```

2. Control Flow Changed Function:
In this version, we will change the way the function executes and flows through control statements. Instead of using NumPy's built-in functions and array operations, we will use control statements and simple arithmetic to create the identity matrix. 

```
def identity_v2(n, dtype=None):
    identity_matrix = []

    for i in range(n):
        row = []

        for j in range(n):
              row.append((i == j) * 1)

        identity_matrix.append(row)

    return identity_matrix
```

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

## Response

Here are the functions enclosed in the requested tags:

```
<DATA>
def identity_v1(n, dtype=None):
    identity_matrix = []

    for i in range(n):
        row = []

            if i == j:
              row.append(1)
            else:
              row.append(0)

        identity_matrix.append(row)

    return identity_matrix
</DATA>
```

```
<CONTROL>

        identity_matrix.append(row)

## Response

| **Input** | **Output** | **Explanation** |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| `identity_v2(2)` | `[[1,0],[0,1]]` | This input creates a 2x2 identity matrix as it loops for `i` and `j` till `n=2`. In the first iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop appends `[1,0]` to the identity matrix. In the second iteration, the inner loop appends `[0,1]` to the identity matrix. |
| `identity_v2(3)` | `[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]` | This input creates a 3x3 identity matrix as it loops for `i` and `j` till `n=3`. In the first iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop appends `[1,0,0]` to the identity matrix. In the second iteration, the inner loop appends `[0,1,0]` to the identity matrix. In the third iteration, the inner loop appends `[0,0,1]` to the identity matrix. |
| `identity_v2(4, dtype=float)` | `[[1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0]]` | This input creates a 4x4 identity matrix of dtype `float` as it loops for `i` and `j` till `n=4`. In the first iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop appends `[1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]` to the identity matrix. In the second iteration, the inner loop appends `[0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0]` to the identity matrix. In the third iteration, the inner loop appends `[0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0]` to the identity matrix. In the fourth iteration, the inner loop appends `[0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0]` to the identity matrix. |

Explanation: 

- The function `identity_v2` takes two parameters: 
  - `n`: an integer that specifies the dimension of the identity matrix to be created.
  - `dtype`: an optional parameter that specifies the data type of the elements of the matrix. The default value is `None`, which means the matrix elements will be of type `int`.

- The identity matrix is initialized as an empty list `identity_matrix`.

- The function then loops over `n` iterations using variable `i` and `j` with a nested loop. 

- In each iteration of the outer loop (indexed by `i`), a new empty list `row` is created.

- In each iteration of the inner loop (indexed by `j`), if `i` is equal to `j`, then append 1 to the `row`, else append 0. 

- Once the inner loop has completed, the full `row` is appended to `identity_matrix`. 

- Once all iterations are complete, `identity_matrix` is returned.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Let's take a look at each of these inputs and outputs and show the calculations and reasons about the execution of the function:

**Input 1:**

```
identity_v2(2)
```

This input will create a 2x2 identity matrix. The function loops over `i` and `j` till `n=2`. In the first iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop appends `[1,0]` to the identity matrix. In the second iteration, the inner loop appends `[0,1]` to the identity matrix. 

```
[1,0] --> i=0, j=0
[0,1] --> i=1, j=1
```

So, the final output will be:

```
[[1,0],
 [0,1]]
```

**Input 2:**

```
identity_v2(3)
```

This input will create a 3x3 identity matrix. The function loops over `i` and `j` till `n=3`. In the first iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop appends `[1,0,0]` to the identity matrix. In the second iteration, the inner loop appends `[0,1,0]` to the identity matrix. In the third iteration, the inner loop appends `[0,0,1]` to the identity matrix. 

```
[1,0,0] --> i=0, j=0
[0,1,0] --> i=1, j=1
[0,0,1] --> i=2, j=2
```

So, the final output will be:

```
[[1,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
```

**Input 3:**

```
identity_v2(4, dtype=float)
```

This input will create a 4x4 identity matrix where its elements are of `dtype=float`. The function loops over `i` and `j` till `n=4`. In the first iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop appends `[1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]` to the identity matrix. In the second iteration, the inner loop appends `[0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0]` to the identity matrix. In the third iteration, the inner loop appends `[0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0]` to the identity matrix. In the fourth iteration, the inner loop appends `[0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0]` to the identity matrix. 

```
[1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0] --> i=0, j=0
[0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0] --> i=1, j=1
[0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0] --> i=2, j=2
[0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0] --> i=3, j=3
```

So, the final output will be:

```
[[1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],
 [0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0],
 [0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0],
 [0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0]]
```

In each case, the function loops through the nested loops for `i` and `j` and appends the value `1` to the `row` when `i` is equal to `j`, and `0` otherwise. These values are then appended to the `identity_matrix` at the end of each iteration. The output is then returned after the completion of all iterations.

## Response

| Input | Output | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `identity_v1(2)` | `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` | The function will create a 2x2 identity matrix, where the diagonal elements are 1 and others are 0. |
| `identity_v1(3)` | `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]` | The function will create a 3x3 identity matrix, which contains 1 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere. |
| `identity_v1(5)` | `[[1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]` | The function will create a 5x5 identity matrix, which contains 1 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere. |

Explanation: 

- The function identity_v1 takes two inputs n and dtype, where n specifies the size of the identity matrix to be created.
- The function initializes an empty list `identity_matrix` to store the identity matrix.
- Then, the function uses two nested for loops to create an identity matrix with n rows and n columns. 
- The outer loop iterates through the rows (from 0 to n-1), and the inner loop iterates through the columns (from 0 to n-1) of the identity matrix. 
- If the row number is equal to the column number, the value 1 is appended to the list `row`, else 0 is appended. 
- After completion of inner loop for each row, the resultant row list is appended to the `identity_matrix` list.
- Finally, the resultant `identity_matrix` list is returned as output.

## Response

**Input 1:** 

```python 
identity_v1(2)
```

**Output 1:**

```python 
[[1, 0], [0, 1]]
```

**Execution Explanation:**

- The function initializes an empty list `identity_matrix` to store the identity matrix.
- The outer loop starts iterating through the rows from 0 to 1.
- Inside the outer loop, the inner loop starts iterating through the columns from 0 to 1, for each row.
- For the first iteration (when i=0 and j=0), `row` is `[]`, and `i==j` holds true, so the value 1 is appended to `row`. `row` becomes `[1]` after this.
- For the second iteration (when i=0 and j=1), `row` is `[1]`, and `i!=j` holds true, so the value 0 is appended to `row`. `row` becomes `[1,0]` after this.
- The inner loop completes for the first row, and `row` is appended to `identity_matrix`. `identity_matrix` becomes `[[1,0]]` after this.
- Now, the outer loop starts iterating for the second row (when i=1). Inside the outer loop, the inner loop starts iterating through the columns from 0 to 1, for the second row.
