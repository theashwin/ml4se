# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

def check_symmetry(A):
    A = asanyarray(A)
    if A.ndim != 2:
        raise ValueError("Checks symmetry only for bi-dimensional arrays.")

    if A.shape[0] != A.shape[1]:
        return False

    return abs(A - A.T).max() < sqrt(finfo(float).eps)

```

## Response

Modified code:
``` python
def check_symmetry_new(B):
    B = asanyarray(B)
    if B.ndim != 2:
        raise ValueError("Checks symmetry only for bi-dimensional arrays.")

    if B.shape[0] != B.shape[1]:
        return False

    return abs(B - B.T).sum() == 0
```
In this modified version, instead of using absolute difference and finding the maximum, the difference of the matrix B and its transpose is simply checked for sum equal to zero to check for symmetry.


Modified Code: 

``` python
def check_even_even(C):
    C = asanyarray(C)
    if C.ndim != 2:
        raise ValueError("Checks evenness only for bi-dimensional arrays.")
    
    sum = 0
    even = True
    
    for i in range(C.ndim):
        for j in range(C.ndim):
            if C[i][j] % 2 != 0:
                even = False
                break
        if not even :
            break
    return even
```
In this modified version, the function checks if all the elements of the given matrix C are even or not to determine if the matrix is even. It does this by using the nested loops and checking for evenness of each element along with a boolean even initialised to True. If any element is odd, the variable even is turned False. If even remains True then the function returns True else False.

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

## Response

Modified Code in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags:

``` python
def check_symmetry_new(B):
    B = asanyarray(B)
    if B.ndim != 2:
        raise ValueError("Checks symmetry only for bi-dimensional arrays.")

    if B.shape[0] != B.shape[1]:
        return False

    return abs(B - B.T).sum() == 0
```

Modified Code in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags:

``` python
def check_even_even(C):
    C = asanyarray(C)
    if C.ndim != 2:
        raise ValueError("Checks evenness only for bi-dimensional arrays.")
    
    sum = 0
    even = True
    
    for i in range(C.ndim):
        for j in range(C.ndim):
            if C[i][j] % 2 != 0:
                even = False
                break
        if not even :
            break
    return even

## Response

There seems to be no code given in the variable 'code'. Please provide the correct input.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

I apologize for the confusion earlier, but since there is no code provided, I cannot generate the execution analysis for any input-output pairs. Please provide the correct code and the required input-output pairs.
