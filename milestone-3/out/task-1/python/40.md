## Response

|   Input   |              Function Execution                |                Output             |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| x = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  | Check if all values in x are the same. nans are ignored. | np.array([True]) |
| x = [1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 2.0, 1.0, np.nan] | Check if all values in x are the same. nans are ignored.  | np.array([False]) |
| x = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, np.nan, np.nan, np.nan] | Check if all values in x are the same. nans are ignored. | np.array([True]) |

The function is_const() checks if all the non-NaN values in the input 1D array x are the same or not. NaNs are ignored in this check. 

The function executes in the following manner:

1. The input argument x is checked for NaN values using the np.isnan(x) method.
2. A new 1D array y is created with all NaN values removed from x. 
3. If the length of y is zero, this means that all the values in x were NaN and the function returns np.array([True]).
4. Else, the function checks if the first value of y is the same as every other value of y. 
5. If yes, the function returns np.array([True]).
6. If no, the function returns np.array([False]).

Note that the output is always a 1D numpy array of length 1, kept true intentionally to keep compatibility with np.apply_along_axis.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. Input: x = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

    In this case, the function will execute in the following manner:
    
    i. x is checked for NaN values - there are none.
    
    ii. A new 1D array y is created with all NaN values removed from x - y = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    
    iii. The function checks if the first value of y is the same as every other value of y. Since all the values in y are the same, the function will return np.array([True]).


2. Input: x = [1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 2.0, 1.0, np.nan]

    In this case, the function will execute in the following manner:
    
    i. x is checked for NaN values - y = [1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 2.0, 1.0]
    
    ii. A new 1D array y is created with all NaN values removed from x - y = [1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 2.0, 1.0]
    
    iii. The function checks if the first value of y is the same as every other value of y. Since 1.0 is not the same as 2.0, 5.0 or np.nan, the function will return np.array([False]).
    

3. Input: x = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, np.nan, np.nan, np.nan]

    In this case, the function will execute in the following manner:
    
    i. x is checked for NaN values - y = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
    
    ii. A new 1D array y is created with all NaN values removed from x - y = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
    
    iii. The function checks if the first value of y is the same as every other value of y. Since all the values in y are the same (i.e. 4), the function will return np.array([True]).

    """
    y = np.where(np.isnan(x), 0, x)
    return (np.ptp(y) == 0).all(keepdims=True)


```

## Response

Inputs:

1) x = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
   It should output True as all the values are same.

2) x = [0,0,0,0,0]
   It should output True as all the values are same.

3) x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7]
   It should output False as not all the values are the same.

Outputs:

1) True
2) True
3) False


Explanation:
1) In the first input, all values of the list are the same, so the function should output True.
2) In the second input, all values of the list are the same, so the function should output True.
3) In the third input, not all values of the list are the same, so the function should output False. The pt.p function is a numpy built-in function that returns the difference between the maximum and minimum array elements. If the difference is zero, all the values are constant. Here, all the values are not the same and therefore, the function should output False.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

For the first input x = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]:

1) The numpy library is imported.
2) The is_const function is defined that checks if all values in x are the same and the function is documented.
3) In the function, the input array x is checked for nans and replaced with 0. This is done using np.where() function.
4) The maximum and the minimum of the array y are taken using the numpy function np.ptp(y). Here, since all the values of y are same, np.ptp(y) will be zero. keepdims parameter in np.ptp(y) gives an output of length 1 when all the values are same and thus, True is returned.

For the second input x = [0,0,0,0,0]:

1) The numpy library is imported.
2) The is_const function is defined that checks if all values in x are the same and the function is documented.
3) In the function, the input array x is checked for nans and replaced with 0. This is done using np.where() function.
4) The maximum and the minimum of the array y are taken using the numpy function np.ptp(y). Here, since all the values of y are same, np.ptp(y) will be zero. keepdims parameter in np.ptp(y) gives an output of length 1 when all the values are same and thus, True is returned.

For the third input x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7]:

1) The numpy library is imported.
2) The is_const function is defined that checks if all values in x are the same and the function is documented.
3) In the function, the input array x is checked for nans and replaced with 0. This is done using np.where() function.
4) The maximum and minimum of the array y are taken using the numpy function np.ptp(y). Here, since all the values of y are not the same, np.ptp(y) will be greater than zero. keepdims parameter in np.ptp(y) gives an output of length 1 when all the values are same and thus, False is returned.
