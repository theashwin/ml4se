## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

def _perm_test(x, y, stat, reps=1000, workers=-1, random_state=None):
    
    # generate seeds for each rep (change to new parallel random number
    # capabilities in numpy >= 1.17+)
    random_state = check_random_state(random_state)
    random_states = [np.random.RandomState(rng_integers(random_state, 1 << 32,
                     size=4, dtype=np.uint32)) for _ in range(reps)]

    # parallelizes with specified workers over number of reps and set seeds
    parallelp = _ParallelP(x=x, y=y, random_states=random_states)
    with MapWrapper(workers) as mapwrapper:
        null_dist = np.array(list(mapwrapper(parallelp, range(reps))))

    # calculate p-value and significant permutation map through list
    pvalue = (1 + (null_dist >= stat).sum()) / (1 + reps)

    return pvalue, null_dist


def _euclidean_dist(x):
    return cdist(x, x)

```

## Response

First Version: Change the data flow of the function

We will change the data flow of the function to receive a list of integers and return a list of squares of each integer. We will also change the name of the function to `int_square_list`.

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

## Response

Sure. Here's the code for the first version:

```python
# <DATA>
def int_square_list(int_list):
    square_list = []
    for i in range(len(int_list)):
        square_list.append(int(int_list[i])**2)
    return square_list
# </DATA>
```

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```

Sure. Here's the code for the first version:

```python
# <DATA>
def int_square_list(int_list):
    square_list = []
    for i in range(len(int_list)):
        square_list.append(int(int_list[i])**2)
    return square_list
# </DATA>
```

```

## Response

Inputs:

| Input | Data Type | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| int_list | List[int] | A list of integers |

Outputs:

| Output | Data Type | Description |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| square_list | List[int] | A list of integers where each element is the square of the corresponding element in int_list. |

Execution:
 
The given function takes an input list of integers and generates a new list by squaring each element of the input list. 

1. It initializes an empty list called square_list.
2. It iterates through each element of int_list using the range and len functions in the for loop.
3. For each iteration, it appends the square of the corresponding element of int_list to square_list.
4. Once all the elements have been processed, it returns the resulting square_list.

The function uses the ** operator to calculate the square of each element and the int function to ensure that the resulting values are integers.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

I'm sorry, in order to do so, I would need to know the input-output pairs that you would like me to use for this task. Could you please provide me with the inputs and their corresponding outputs that you would like me to use?

## Response

| **Input** | **Output** | **Explanation** |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| [1, 2, 3] | [1, 4, 9] | The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing squares of integers in the input list. In this case, a list [1, 2, 3] is given as the input and the function returns a new list [1, 4, 9] where each element is a square of the corresponding element in the input list. |
| [-3, -2, 0] | [9, 4, 0] | The function works with negative integers as well as zero. In this case, the function receives [-3, -2, 0] as input and returns a new list [9, 4, 0] of squares of the elements of the input list.|
| [2.5, 3.7, 4] | [6.25, 13.69, 16] | The function works with floating-point numbers as inputs. In this case, the input list has floating-point numbers [2.5, 3.7, 4] and returns a new list [6.25, 13.69, 16] where each element of the new list is a result of squaring the corresponding element of the input list. However, the resulting list has floating-point values but not integers. |

The function `int_square_list` takes an input list of integers and returns a new list containing squares of the integers in the input list. The function first initializes an empty list `square_list`. Inside a for loop, it squares each element of the input list, appends it to `square_list` and then returns `square_list`. This function works with lists containing negative integers, zero, floats, and it converts them into squared integers.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. **Input: [1, 2, 3] Output: [1, 4, 9]**

  * On the first iteration, `i` takes the value 0. The function retrieves the value `int_list[0]` which is 1 and squares it. The resulting value is 1. 
  * On the second iteration, `i` takes the value 1. The value `int_list[1]` is 2, and 2 is squared and added to the `square_list`. The list `square_list` now contains [1, 4]. 
  * On the third iteration, `i` takes the value 2. The value `int_list[2]` is 3, and 3 is squared and added to the `square_list`. `square_list` now contains [1, 4, 9]. 
  * The for-loop exits, and the function returns `square_list`, which is the final output.

2. **Input: [-3, -2, 0], Output: [9, 4, 0]**

  * On the first iteration, `i` takes the value 0. The function retrieves the value `int_list[0]` which is -3 and squares it. The resulting value is 9. 
  * On the second iteration, `i` takes the value 1. The value `int_list[1]` is -2, and -2 is squared resulting in 4 which is added to the `square_list`. The list `square_list` now contains [9, 4]. 
  * On the third iteration, `i` takes the value 2. The value `int_list[2]` is 0, and 0 is squared resulting in 0 which is appended to the `square_list`. `square_list` now contains [9, 4, 0]. 
  * The for-loop exits, and the function returns `square_list`, which is the final output.
    
3. **Input: [2.5, 3.7, 4], Output: [6.25, 13.69, 16]**

  * On the first iteration, `i` takes the value 0. The function retrieves the value `int_list[0]` which is 2.5 and converts it into an integer and then squares it. The resulting value is 6 as 2.5 is rounded down to the nearest integer. 
  * On the second iteration, `i` takes the value 1. The value `int_list[1]` is 3.7, and 3 is squared resulting in 9 which is added to the `square_list`. The list `square_list` now contains [6, 9]. 
  * On the third iteration, `i` takes the value 2. The value `int_list[2]` is 4, and 4 is squared resulting in 16 which is appended to the `square_list`. `square_list` now contains [6, 9, 16]. 
  * The for-loop exits, and the function returns `square_list`, which is the final output.
