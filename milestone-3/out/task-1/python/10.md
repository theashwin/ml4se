Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

```

## Response

As instructed, the function 'new_lu_solve_ctrl' takes in two arguments, 'LU' and 'b'. The function uses a while loop to perform LU decomposition of the matrix. In each step, it checks if there are any remaining columns or rows in the matrix that need to be transformed and finds the pivot element for the current iteration. It then performs transformations on the rows/columns of the matrix and updates the matrix with the new transformations. Finally, it uses the resulting transformed matrix to solve for 'b' and returns the solution.

Example 1:
LU = [[1, 0, 0], [2, 1, 0], [3, 4, 1]]
b = [6, 7, 8]
Output:
[6.0, -1.0, 1.0]

Example 2:
LU = [[1, 0, 0], [2, 1, 0], [3, 4, 1]]
b = [0, 0, 0]
Output:
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

Example 3:
LU = [[3, 1, 2], [6, 3, 4], [9, 5, 8]]
b = [10, 20, 30]
Output:
[9.25925925925926, -5.185185185185185, 2.2222222222222223]

The function executes LU decomposition step by step using while loop. It checks if there are any remaining columns or rows in the matrix that need to be transformed, finds the pivot element for the current iteration, performs transformations on the rows/columns of the matrix, updates the matrix with the new transformations and repeats the process until all iterations are complete. Finally, the transformed matrix is used to solve for 'b' and the solution is returned.

## Prompt

## Response

For input1: input1 = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]

- Convert all input arguments to numpy array of floats: np.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3], dtype=float)
- Calculate the product of all input arrays: np.product(np.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3], dtype=float)) = 8.658
- Take a log of the product: np.log(8.658) = 2.160222170882439
- Return the absolute value of the log: abs(2.160222170882439) = 2.160222170882439
