# Task 1: Data Control

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

import numpy as np
from numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix import matrix, asmatrix
from numpy import *  

def empty(shape, dtype=None, order='C'):
   
    return ndarray.__new__(matrix, shape, dtype, order=order)

```

## Response

New function with changed data flow:

```python
def empty(shape, dtype=None, order='C'):
    if dtype is None:
        dtype = np.float64
    
    return np.empty(shape, dtype=dtype, order=order)

```

New function with changed control flow:

```python
def empty(shape, dtype=None, order='C'):
   
    if order == 'C':
        return np.zeros(shape, dtype=dtype, order=order)
    else:
        return np.ones(shape, dtype=dtype, order=order)

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

## Response

Enclosed data flow mutated function:

```
<DATA>
def empty(shape, dtype=None, order='C'):
    if dtype is None:
        dtype = np.float64
    
    return np.empty(shape, dtype=dtype, order=order)
</DATA>

## Response

| **Input** | **Output** | **Explanation** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `(2, 3)` | `array([[0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.]])` | The input `shape` is `(2, 3)`. The `order` is set to the default value `'C'`. The function returns an array of shape `(2, 3)` filled with zeros. |
|`(1, 4), int` | `array([[0, 0, 0, 0]])` | The input `shape` is `(1, 4)`. The `dtype` is set to `int`. Since the order is `'C'`, the function returns a 2D array of shape `(1, 4)` filled with integers 0. |
|`(3, 2), None, 'F'` | `array([[1., 1.], [1., 1.], [1., 1.]])` | The input `shape` is `(3, 2)`. `dtype` is set to `None`. The `order` is set to `'F'`. Since `order` is not `'C'`, the function returns an array of shape `(3, 2)` filled with `1`s. | 

Explanation:

The function `empty()` takes 3 arguments: `shape`, `dtype` and `order`. 
- `shape` specifies the dimensions of the array to be created. It is a required argument.
- `dtype` is an optional argument which specifies the data type of the array to be created. If not specified, it defaults to `None`.
- `order` specifies the memory layout of the array to be created. If set to `'C'`, the array is created in row-major (C-style) order. If set to `'F'` (Fortran-style) then the array is created in column-major order. The default value of `order` is `'C'`. 

Inside the function, `if` statement checks if `order` is set to `'C'`. If yes, `np.zeros()` function is called with `shape`, `dtype` and `order` to create an array of zeros. Otherwise, `np.ones()` function is called with the same arguments to create an array of ones. Finally, the created array is returned as the output.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

For the following calculations, we need to first import the required library using the following code:
```python
import numpy as np
```

#### Example 1:

```python
empty((2, 3))
```

This function call will return an array of shape `(2, 3)` filled with zeros. 

- `shape` parameter is set to `(2, 3)`.
- Since we do not specify a `dtype`, it defaults to `None`.
- The `order` parameter is set to `'C'` by default.

Now, the `empty()` function returns `np.zeros((2, 3), dtype=None, order='C')`. 

Therefore, the output of the function will be:

```
array([[0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0.]])
```

#### Example 2:

```python
empty((1, 4), int)
```

This function call will return an array of shape `(1, 4)` filled with integers 0. 

- `shape` parameter is set to `(1, 4)`.
- Since we specify a `dtype` as `int`, the array that's returned contains 0 as integers.
- The `order` parameter is set to `'C'` by default.

Now, the `empty()` function returns `np.zeros((1, 4), dtype=int, order='C')`. 

Therefore, the output of the function will be:

```
array([[0, 0, 0, 0]])
```

#### Example 3:

```python
empty((3, 2), None, 'F')
```

This function call will return an array of shape `(3, 2)` filled with ones.

- `shape` parameter is set to `(3, 2)`.
- We do not specify a `dtype`, so it defaults to `None`.
- The `order` parameter is set to `'F'`.

Since order is not `'C'`, the `empty()` function returns `np.ones((3, 2), dtype=None, order='F')`.

Therefore, the output of the function will be:

```
array([[1., 1.],
       [1., 1.],
       [1., 1.]])
```

## Response

| Input        | Output           | Explanation  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| (3,)      | An empty NumPy array of shape (3,) with default dtype np.float64 and order 'C'. | The function creates an empty NumPy array of shape (3,) with default dtype set to np.float64 and default order set to 'C'. The dtype default value is set to np.float64 using the if...else statement. By default, order argument is set to 'C', hence it is not passed any arguments in this case.|
| (2,4), int     | An empty NumPy array of shape (2,4) with dtype=int and default order 'C'. | The function creates an empty NumPy array of shape (2,4) with dtype=int and default order set to 'C'. The dtype argument passed to the function is int which is then used to create the NumPy array. The order is already set to default value. |
|(3,2), np.int32, 'F'| An empty NumPy array of shape (3,2) with dtype=np.int32 and order 'F'. | The function creates an empty NumPy array of shape (3,2) with dtype as np.int32 and order as 'F'. The dtype and order argument is passed a value. Hence, the function will use the passed values instead of their default values. |


## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

**Input 1: (3,)**

To execute the first input, the function will execute the following statements:
1. The function receives input tuple of shape (3,) which is assigned to the parameter `shape`.
2. Since dtype is None in the function definition, the if statement will be executed with dtype assigned to np.float64.
3. The function returns np.empty of shape (3,) with dtype set to np.float64 and default order 'C'.

Hence, the output of the function will be an empty NumPy array of shape (3,) with default dtype np.float64 and order 'C'.


**Input 2: (2,4), int**

To execute the second input, the function will execute the following statements:
1. The function receives input tuple of shape (2,4) which is assigned to the parameter `shape`.
2. Since dtype is not None in the function call with value int, the statement dtype = np.float64 is not executed and dtype is assigned the passed value of int.
3. The function returns np.empty of shape (2,4) with dtype set to int and default order 'C'.

Hence, the output of the function will be an empty NumPy array of shape (2,4) with dtype as int and default order 'C'. 


**Input 3: (3,2), np.int32, 'F'**

To execute the third input, the function will execute the following statements:
1. The function receives input tuple of shape (3,2) which is assigned to the parameter `shape`.
2. Since dtype is not None in the function call with value np.int32, the statement dtype = np.float64 is not executed and dtype is assigned the passed value of np.int32.
3. The function returns np.empty of shape (3,2) with dtype set to np.int32 and order set to 'F' passed in the function call. 

Hence, the output of the function will be an empty NumPy array of shape (3,2) with dtype as np.int32 and order as 'F'.
