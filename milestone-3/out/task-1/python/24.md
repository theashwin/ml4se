**func_id** : 24 <br/> 
 **repository** : https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/numpy <br/> 
**location** : numpy/numpy/matlib.py <br/> 
**flag** : medium <br/> 
**function** : <br/> 
``` <br/> 
import numpy as np
from numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix import matrix, asmatrix
from numpy import *  

def identity(n,dtype=None):
def eye(n,M=None, k=0, dtype=float, order='C'):
    return asmatrix(np.eye(n, M=M, k=k, dtype=dtype, order=order)) 
``` 


# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

import numpy as np
from numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix import matrix, asmatrix
from numpy import *  

def identity(n,dtype=None):
def eye(n,M=None, k=0, dtype=float, order='C'):
    return asmatrix(np.eye(n, M=M, k=k, dtype=dtype, order=order))

```

## Response

New version with changed data flow:

Instructions:
- The function should take in a list of lists and a value x as input.
- The function should first check if x is present in any of the sublists.
- If it is, the function should return the index of the first sublist in which x appears.
- If it is not, the function should return -1.

Here's the new version of the function:

```
def identity(lst, x):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if x in lst[i]:
            return i
    return -1
```

New version with changed control flow:

Instructions:
- The function should take in a dictionary as input.
- The function should check if the dictionary has the key 'name'.
- If it does not, it should return the string "No name found".
- If it does, the function should check if the value of the 'name' key is empty or not.
- If it is empty, the function should return the string "Empty name".
- If it is not empty, the function should return the string "Name is present".

Here's the new version of the function:

```
def identity(dct):
    if 'name' not in dct:
        return "No name found"
    elif dct['name'] == "":
        return "Empty name"
    else:
        return "Name is present"
```

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

## Response

Data flow mutated function enclosed in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags:

```
<DATA>
def identity(lst, x):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if x in lst[i]:
            return i
    return -1
</DATA>
```

Control flow mutated function enclosed in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags:

```
<CONTROL>
def identity(dct):
    if 'name' not in dct:
        return "No name found"
    elif dct['name'] == "":
        return "Empty name"
    else:
        return "Name is present"
</CONTROL>
```

# Task 1: Reasoning for Control Flow Mutated Function

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```

` `

```

## Response

Oops! It looks like there is no code present. Can you please provide the code so that I can assist you further?

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Without the code, I cannot provide specific calculations and reasons about execution for any input/output pairs. Can you please provide the code for me to assist you better?

## Response

There seems to be no code in the variable 'code'. Could you please provide the code so that I can assist you with the task?

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

I'm sorry, but you still haven't provided the code and the three input-output pairs. Could you please provide them so that I can assist you with the task?
