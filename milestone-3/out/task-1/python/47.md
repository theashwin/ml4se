## Response

Inputs:
- u = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
- v = [[0, 0, 0], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]

Outputs:
- x = [[ 1.  2.  3.]
 [ 4.  5.  6.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.]
 [ 7.  8.  9.]
 [10. 11. 12.]]
- y = [[0.]
 [0.]
 [1.]
 [1.]
 [1.]]

Inputs:
- u = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
- v = []

Outputs:
- Incorrect form passed as array v
- None

Inputs:
- u = [1, 2, 3]
- v = [[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

Outputs:
- Incorrect form passed as array u
- None

Explanation:
- The function concatenates two input arrays u and v along axis 0 to form x
- The function creates a label array y with 0s corresponding to the samples in u and 1s corresponding to the samples in v.
- If the inputs are not in proper shape or some error occurs in concatenation, it returns None.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

For the first input `[u = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], v = [[0, 0, 0], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]`:
- The shape of u is `(2, 3)` and the shape of v is `(3, 3)` so `n_u=2, n_v=3, p=3, n=n_u+n_v=5`
- Concatenation of u and v along axis 0 gives x which is,
  ```
  x = np.concatenate([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [0, 0, 0], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], axis=0)
    = [[ 1.  2.  3.]
       [ 4.  5.  6.]
       [ 0.  0.  0.]
       [ 7.  8.  9.]
       [10. 11. 12.]]
  ```
- Label matrix y is created by concatenating an array of `n_u` 0s and `n_v` 1s, which is reshaped to `(n+m,1)`
  ```
  y = np.concatenate([np.zeros(n_u), np.ones(n_v)], axis=0).reshape(-1, 1)
    = [[0.]
       [0.]
       [1.]
       [1.]
       [1.]]
  ```
- The function returns the array x and y as outputs.

For the second input `[u = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], v = []]`:
- The shape of u is `(2, 2)` and the shape of v is `(0,)`, `n_v` will not be defined correctly, hence it returns "Incorrect form passed as array v" message and None.

For the third input `[u = [1, 2, 3], v = [[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]]`:
- The shape of u is `(3,)` which will raise an error, hence it returns "Incorrect form passed as array u" message and None.

## Response

Inputs:

3. Calculate n as the sum of n_u and n_v, where n = 5.
