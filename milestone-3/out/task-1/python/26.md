# Task 1: Data Control

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

import numpy as np
from numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix import matrix, asmatrix
from numpy import *  

def randn(*args):
    if isinstance(args[0], tuple):
        args = args[0]
    return asmatrix(np.random.randn(*args))

```

## Response

Version 1: Data Flow Changed

Code:

import numpy as np
from numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix import matrix, asmatrix
from numpy import *


def randn(*args):
    if isinstance(args[0], tuple):
        args = args[0]
    rand_vals = np.random.randn(*args)
    rand_mtx = asmatrix(rand_vals)   
    return np.array(rand_mtx, copy=False)


In the modified function, we have changed the data flow to first generate random values using np.random.randn(). We have then converted the values into a matrix using asmatrix(). Finally, we have converted the matrix back to an array using np.array(). This way, the data flow of the function is changed. 


Version 2: Control Flow Changed

Code:

import numpy as np
from numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix import matrix, asmatrix
from numpy import *


def randn(*args):
    try:
        if isinstance(args[0], tuple):
            args = args[0]
        return asmatrix(np.random.randn(*args))
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error: ", e)
    finally:
        print("Function execution completed.")


In the modified function, we have changed the control flow to include try-except-finally blocks. This way, we check if any exception occurs during the execution of the function. If an exception occurs, the error message is printed. The finally block is added to print a message once the function execution is completed.

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

## Response

Version 1: Data Flow Changed
```
<DATA>
import numpy as np
from numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix import matrix, asmatrix
from numpy import *


def randn(*args):
    if isinstance(args[0], tuple):
        args = args[0]
    rand_vals = np.random.randn(*args)
    rand_mtx = asmatrix(rand_vals)   
    return np.array(rand_mtx, copy=False)
</DATA>
```

Version 2: Control Flow Changed
```
<CONTROL>
import numpy as np
from numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix import matrix, asmatrix
from numpy import *


def randn(*args):
    try:
        if isinstance(args[0], tuple):

        return asmatrix(np.random.randn(*args))
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error: ", e)
    finally:
        print("Function execution completed.")
</CONTROL>

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```


import numpy as np
from numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix import matrix, asmatrix
from numpy import *


def randn(*args):
    try:
        if isinstance(args[0], tuple):
            args = args[0]
        return asmatrix(np.random.randn(*args))
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error: ", e)
    finally:
        print("Function execution completed.")


```

## Response

Inputs:

Assume the inputs to be the following tuples: 

1. `(3,2)`
2. `(4,6,8)`
3. `(5)`

Outputs:

1. A 3x2 matrix filled with random numbers from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
2. A 4x6x8 3-dimensional array filled with random numbers from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
3. A 1x5 matrix filled with random numbers from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

Execution of the function:
- The function `randn` defines a function to generate normally distributed random numbers using numpy.
- It first imports the required libraries: `numpy` and `asmatrix` from `matrixlib.defmatrix`.
- It then defines a function called `randn` which takes any number of arguments and returns a matrix of normally distributed random numbers with dimensions specified by the input arguments.
- The function checks if the first argument is a tuple. If it is, it sets the values of `args` to be the elements of the tuple. Otherwise, `args` is set to be the full set of input arguments.
- The function then generates a matrix of random numbers using `np.random.randn()` with the dimensions specified in `args`.
- If any errors occur during execution, the function catches them and prints an error message. Otherwise, the function prints a message indicating that execution is complete.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

For the first input `(3,2)`:

- The function first checks if the first argument is a tuple, which is true in this case.
- The values of `args` are then set to `(3,2)`.
- The function then generates a matrix of normally distributed random numbers using `np.random.randn(3,2)`.
- The matrix is then converted to an `asmatrix` and returned as the output of the function.
- The `finally` block of the function then executes, printing the message "Function execution completed."


For the second input `(4,6,8)`:
- The function first checks if the first argument is a tuple, which is true in this case.
- The values of `args` are then set to `(4,6,8)`.
- The function then generates a 3-dimensional array of normally distributed random numbers using `np.random.randn(4,6,8)`.
- The array is then converted to an `asmatrix` and returned as the output of the function.
- The `finally` block of the function then executes, printing the message "Function execution completed."


For the third input `(5)`:
- The function first checks if the first argument is a tuple, which is false in this case.
- `args` is then set to `(5)`.
- The function then generates a matrix of normally distributed random numbers using `np.random.randn(5)`.
- The matrix is then converted to an `asmatrix` and returned as the output of the function.
- The `finally` block of the function then executes, printing the message "Function execution completed."

## Response

| randn()      |Error: TypeError: randn() takes at least 1 argument (0 given) |

Explanation:

**Input 1:** `randn(2,2)` 

In this case, the function is called with two arguments - 2 and 2, which are passed to `np.random.randn()`. This returns a 2x2 array of normally distributed random numbers. This array is then converted to a matrix using `asmatrix()`, which returns a matrix of the same dimensions. Finally, the matrix is transformed into a numpy array using `np.array()`, which returns a copy of the array. The output is a 2x2 numpy array of random numbers.


**Input 2:** `randn((2,2))`

In this case, the function is called with a single argument - a tuple (2,2). Since the first argument is a tuple, the function takes all of the arguments by unpacking the tuple using `*args`. Next, it is the same as Input 1 described above. The output is a 2x2 numpy array of random numbers.


**Input 3:** `randn()`

In this case, the function is called without any arguments. The first conditional check in the function filters tuples and hence raises a type error. Thus it throws the error: `TypeError: randn() takes at least 1 argument (0 given)`.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

**Input 1:** `randn(2,2)` 

- The argument (2,2) is passed as `*args` to `randn()` function.
- The `isinstance()` conditional checks if the first argument is a tuple, in this case, it's True.
- It creates a numpy matrix of shape (2,2) containing random samples from a standard normal distribution using `np.random.randn(*args)` method.
- This matrix is cast into a numpy matrix using `asmatrix()` to perform matrix operations, calculate means, and more.
- Finally, it converts the matrix to a numpy array using `np.array()`.
- The returned numpy array with random numbers has dimensions 2x2.


**Input 2:** `randn((2,2))` 

- The tuple (2,2) is passed as *args tuple to `randn()` function.
- The `isinstance()` conditional still filters since the first argument is a tuple and proceeds to the next step.
- It creates a numpy matrix of shape (2,2) containing random samples from a standard normal distribution using `np.random.randn(*args)` method.
- This matrix is cast into a numpy matrix using `asmatrix()` to perform matrix operations, calculate means, and more.
- Finally, it converts the matrix to a numpy array using `np.array()`.
- The returned numpy array with random numbers has dimensions 2x2.


**Input 3:** `randn()`

- The function `randn()` is called with no arguments passed.
- The `isinstance()` conditional fails since there is no argument passed and raises a type error.
- It throws the error: `TypeError: randn() takes at least 1 argument (0 given)`.
