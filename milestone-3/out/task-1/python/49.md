# Task 1: Data Control

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

def _count(a, axis=None):
    if hasattr(a, 'count'):
        num = a.count(axis=axis)
        if isinstance(num, np.ndarray) and num.ndim == 0:
            # In some cases, the `count` method returns a scalar array (e.g.
            # np.array(3)), but we want a plain integer.
            num = int(num)
    else:
        if axis is None:
            num = a.size
        else:
            num = a.shape[axis]
    return num

```

## Response

Modified data flow function:
```python
import numpy as np

def count(a, axis=None):
    try:
        num = a.count(axis=axis)
    except:
        if axis is None:
            num = a.size
        else:
            num = a.shape[axis]
    else:
        if isinstance(num, np.ndarray) and num.ndim == 0:
            num = int(num)
    finally:
        return num
```

Modified control flow function:
```python
def count(a, axis=None):
    num = None
    while num is None:
        try:
            num = a.count(axis=axis)
        except:
            if axis is None:
                num = a.size
            else:
                num = a.shape[axis]
        else:
            if isinstance(num, np.ndarray) and num.ndim == 0:
                num = int(num)
    return num
```

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

## Response

Mutated data flow function:
```python

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```


def count(a, axis=None):
    num = None
    while num is None:
        try:
            num = a.count(axis=axis)
        except:
            if axis is None:
                num = a.size
            else:
                num = a.shape[axis]
        else:
            if isinstance(num, np.ndarray) and num.ndim == 0:
                num = int(num)
    return num


```

## Response

Inputs:

1. a = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5], axis = None
   Output: 8

2. a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], axis = 1
   Output: 3

3. a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]), axis = 0
   Output: 3

Execution:

1. The function takes 'a' and 'axis' as input parameters.
2. It initializes 'num' variable to None.
3. It starts a while loop which runs until 'num' variable is set to a value other than None.
4. Inside the while loop, it tries to find the count of 'a' along the specified axis using the count() function.
5. If it fails to find the count, it checks if the 'axis' parameter is None.
6. If 'axis' is None, it sets 'num' to the size of 'a'.
7. If 'axis' is not None, it sets 'num' to the shape of 'a' along the specified axis.
8. If the count is successfully found, it checks if 'num' is an instance of numpy ndarray and has only one dimension.
9. If the above condition is true, it converts 'num' to an integer.
10. Finally, it returns the value of 'num'.

Note: In the given code, numpy library is not imported, so the code will break at line number 10 if executed as it is.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

First input: a = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5], axis = None
```
num = None  # Assigns num to None
while num is None:  # Enters the loop as num is None
    try:
        num = a.count(axis=axis)  # Tries to get count of a, but TypeError is thrown as 'axis' is not a valid keyword argument for list.count()
    except:
        if axis is None:
            num = a.size  # Finds the number of elements in 'a'
        else:
            num = a.shape[axis]  # Assigns the length of any dimension specified by 'axis' to 'num'
    else:
        if isinstance(num, np.ndarray) and num.ndim == 0:  # Checks if 'num' is a numpy ndarray with one dimension
            num = int(num)  # Converts 'num' to an integer
return num  # Returns the value of num which is 8
```
Output for first input: 8

Second input: a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], axis = 1
```
num = None  # Assigns num to None
while num is None:  # Enters the loop as num is None
    try:
        num = a.count(axis=axis)  # Tries to get count of 'a' along axis 1, but AttributeError is raised as 'list' object has no attribute 'count'
    except:
        if axis is None:
            num = a.size  # Finds the number of elements in 'a'
        else:
            num = a.shape[axis]  # Assigns the length of any dimension specified by 'axis' to 'num'
    else:
        if isinstance(num, np.ndarray) and num.ndim == 0:  # Checks if 'num' is a numpy ndarray with one dimension
            num = int(num)
return num  # Returns the value of num which is 3 (length of a along axis 1)
```
Output for second input: 3

Third input: a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]), axis = 0
```
num = None  # Assigns num to None
while num is None:  # Enters the loop as num is None
    try:
        num = a.count(axis=axis)  # Tries to get count of 'a' along axis 0, but AttributeError is raised as 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'count'
    except:
        if axis is None:
            num = a.size  # Finds the number of elements in 'a'
        else:
            num = a.shape[axis]  # Assigns the length of any dimension specified by 'axis' to 'num'
    else:
        if isinstance(num, np.ndarray) and num.ndim == 0:  # Checks if 'num' is a numpy ndarray with one dimension
            num = int(num)
return num  # Returns the value of num which is 3 (length of a along axis 0)
```
Output for third input: 3

Note: In the given code, numpy library is not imported, so the code will break at line number 10 if executed as it is.

## Response

| Input | Output | Explanation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| [1,2,3,4,5]    | 5        | Here the function is counting the number of elements in an array. Since the input is a list, the function automatically converts it into a ndarray before counting the number of elements. Hence the answer is 5 |
| ('a','b','c')  | 3        | Here the input is a tuple. Since tuples do not have the count function, an exception is raised and it goes to the except block. Since axis is None and the input is not an array, the number of elements in the tuple is counted to give the output 3. |
| np.array([[1,2],[3,4]]) | 2 | Here the input is a 2D array. The count function is called first but it raises an exception since the count function for an array is different. So it goes to the except block where the shape of the input array is used to find the length of the axis mentioned. Since axis is not None, it gives the output 2. |

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. Input : [1,2,3,4,5]   Output : 5

The input is a list [1,2,3,4,5]. This is passed to the function count(a, axis=None). Since the input is not an ndarray, the count function raises an exception and goes into the except block. Here the input size is directly returned since axis is None. Hence the output is 5.

2. Input : ('a','b','c')   Output : 3

The input is a tuple ('a','b','c'). This is passed to the function count(a, axis=None). Since the input is not an ndarray, the count function raises an exception and goes into the except block. Here the input size is directly returned since axis is None. Hence the output is 3.

3. Input : np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])   Output : 2

The input is a 2D array np.array([[1,2],[3,4]]). This is passed to the function count(a, axis=None). The count function for ndarrays is called which tries to find the number of non-zero elements in the array. Since the input array is not boolean, this function raises an exception, and goes into the except block. Here the output dimenstion along the specified axis is returned (dimension of row:axis=0 or dimension of column:axis=1). Since axis has a value of 0, we get the length of the row i.e 2 and it is returned as output.

## Observation

GPT is capable of providing suitable reasoning and interpretations for calculations in the context of Data Flow. Meanwhile, for Control Flow, Chat GPT generates code that is semantically accurate and accompanied by appropriate reasoning.
