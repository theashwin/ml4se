# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

def economic_qs_linear(G):
    import dask.array as da

    if not isinstance(G, da.Array):
        G = asarray(G, float)

    if G.shape[0] > G.shape[1]:
        (Q, Ssq, _) = svd(G, full_matrices=True)
        S0 = Ssq ** 2
        rank = len(S0)
        Q0, Q1 = Q[:, :rank], Q[:, rank:]
        return ((Q0, Q1), S0)

    return economic_qs(G.dot(G.T))

```

## Response

New Function 1 : Change in Control Flow
```
The existing code uses if-else statements to determine the data flow of the function. 

In the new function, we can use a try-except block instead. 

This way we can handle any kind of data type including strings, lists, or any other iterable.
```

```
import dask.array as da

def economic_qs_try(G):
    try:
        G = da.array(G, dtype='float')
        if G.shape[0] > G.shape[1]:
            (Q, Ssq, _) = svd(G, full_matrices=True)
            S0 = Ssq ** 2
            rank = len(S0)
            Q0, Q1 = Q[:, :rank], Q[:, rank:]
            return ((Q0, Q1), S0)
        else:
            return economic_qs(G.dot(G.T))
    except:
        raise ValueError("Invalid Input!")
```


New Function 2 : Change in Data Flow
```
In the existing code, the function will accept an array and if the number of rows is greater than the number of columns, it will perform a singular value decomposition operation. 

In the new function, we can convert the array into a pandas dataframe and then perform a linear regression.
```

```
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def economic_qs_linear_regression(G):
    if not isinstance(G, pd.DataFrame):
        G = pd.DataFrame(G)

    if G.shape[0] > G.shape[1]:
        X = G.iloc[:, :-1]
        y = G.iloc[:, -1]
        regressor = LinearRegression()
        regressor.fit(X, y)
        return regressor.intercept_, regressor.coef_
    
    raise ValueError("Invalid Input!")
```

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

## Response

Here are the functions with data flow mutated function enclosed in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function enclosed in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.

```
<DATA>
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def economic_qs_linear_regression(G):
    if not isinstance(G, pd.DataFrame):
        G = pd.DataFrame(G)

    if G.shape[0] > G.shape[1]:
        X = G.iloc[:, :-1]
        y = G.iloc[:, -1]
        regressor = LinearRegression()
        regressor.fit(X, y)
        return regressor.intercept_, regressor.coef_
    
    raise ValueError("Invalid Input!")
</DATA>
```

```
<CONTROL>
import dask.array as da

def economic_qs_try(G):
    try:
        G = da.array(G, dtype='float')
        if G.shape[0] > G.shape[1]:
            (Q, Ssq, _) = svd(G, full_matrices=True)
            S0 = Ssq ** 2
            rank = len(S0)
            Q0, Q1 = Q[:, :rank], Q[:, rank:]
            return ((Q0, Q1), S0)
        else:
            return economic_qs(G.dot(G.T))
    except:
        raise ValueError("Invalid Input!")

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```

` `

```

## Response

There seems to be no code provided in the variable 'code'. Can you please provide the code so that I can assist you with your question?

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

I'm sorry, but without the code or the input-output pairs you would like me to analyze, I cannot provide you with the calculations and execution analysis you are requesting. Please provide me with those details so that I can better assist you.
