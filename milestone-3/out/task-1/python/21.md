## Response

| **Input** | **Output** | **Explanation** |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| `ones((2, 2))` | `matrix([[1., 1.], [1., 1.]])` | `ones` function is being called with shape=(2, 2), therefore the function will create a 2x2 matrix inside a try-except block. If it fails to create, then it will create a numpy array of shape=(2, 2). Later, it will fill the resultant with ones and return it. Therefore, creating a matrix of shape=(2, 2) where all the elements are 1. |
| `ones((3, 4), dtype=float)` | `matrix([[1., 1., 1., 1.], [1., 1., 1., 1.], [1., 1., 1., 1.]])` | `ones` function is being called with shape=(3, 4) and dtype=float, therefore the function will create a 3x4 matrix with dtype float64 inside a try-except block. If it fails to create, then it will create a numpy array of shape=(3, 4) with dtype=float64. Later, it will fill the resultant with ones and return it. Therefore, creating a matrix of shape=(3, 4) with dtype=float64 where all the elements are 1. |
| `ones((2, 3), dtype=str)` | `TypeError` | `ones` function is being called with shape=(2, 3) and dtype=str which is not compatible. Therefore, it will return a TypeError after trying to create an ndarray of shape=(2, 3) with dtype=str. |

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

For `ones((2, 2))`:

- Function is called with `shape=(2, 2)` and `dtype=None` by default.
- Inside the function, dtype is checked to see if it is None or not. As dtype is None, dtype is now assigned integer data type.
- Now `try` block is initiated and `ndarray.__new__(matrix, shape, dtype, order=order)` is called inside this block.
- With the given input, which is `shape=(2, 2)` and `dtype=int`, `ndarray.__new__(matrix, shape, dtype, order=order)` fails to create a matrix because `dtype=int` is not compatible with `matrix` data type.
- So, the function goes to the `except` block.
- Inside the `except` block, `np.ones(shape=shape, dtype=dtype, order=order)` is called and this function returns a 2x2 array with dtype=int.
- Then, `np.matrix(a)` converts this array to a matrix
- Now the `else` block is initiated and `a.fill(1)` fills this matrix with 1.
- Finally, the function returns the matrix which contains 2 rows and 2 columns, with all the elements being 1. So, the output is `matrix([[1., 1.], [1., 1.]])`

For `ones((3, 4), dtype=float)`:

- Function is called with `shape=(3, 4)` and `dtype=float`.
- Inside the function, dtype is checked to see if it is None or not. As dtype is float, dtype stays the same.
- Now `try` block is initiated and `ndarray.__new__(matrix, shape, dtype, order=order)` is called inside this block.
- With the given input, which is `shape=(3, 4)` and `dtype=float`, `ndarray.__new__(matrix, shape, dtype, order=order)` creates a 3x4 matrix of dtype float64.
- Now this matrix is filled with ones using `a.fill(1)` which gives a matrix of shape=(3, 4) with dtype float64, where all the elements are 1.
- Finally, the function returns the resultant matrix. So, the output is `matrix([[1., 1., 1., 1.], [1., 1., 1., 1.], [1., 1., 1., 1.]])`.

For `ones((2, 3), dtype=str)`:

- Function is called with `shape=(2, 3)` and `dtype=str`.
- Inside the function, dtype is checked to see if it is None or not. As dtype is string, dtype stays the same.
- Now `try` block is initiated and `ndarray.__new__(matrix, shape, dtype, order=order)` is called inside this block.
- With the given input, which is `shape=(2, 3)` and `dtype=str`, `ndarray.__new__(matrix, shape, dtype, order=order)` fails to create a matrix because `dtype=str` is not compatible with `matrix` data type.
- So, the function goes to the `except` block and tries to create an ndarray of shape=(2, 3) with dtype `str` which is not possible. Therefore, it raises a `TypeError`.

    return arr
```

## Response

| Input | Data Type | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| shape=3, dtype=int, order='C' | Integer | 2D array with shape (3,3) containing dtype=int with all elements equal to 1. |
| shape=5, dtype=float, order='F' | Integer, Float   | 2D array with shape (5,5) containing dtype=float with all elements equal to 1. |
| shape=-3, dtype=bool, order=None | Integer, Boolean | Raises ValueError indicating that Input shape must be a positive integer. |

Explanation:

- The function 'ones' is defined which accepts three parameters shape, dtype, order.
- The function first checks if the input shape is a positive integer. If not, it raises an error.
- If the input shape is a positive integer, it creates a 2D array of given 'shape' and 'dtype' with all elements equal to 1 using the inbuilt function np.ones().
- Finally, it returns the 2D array as output. 
- For the first input with shape=3, dtype=int, order='C' the output generated is a 2D array with shape (3,3) containing dtype=int with all elements equal to 1.
- For the second input with shape=5, dtype=float, order='F' the output generated is a 2D array with shape (5,5) containing dtype=float with all elements equal to 1.
- For the third input with shape=-3, dtype=bool, order=None, the function raises a ValueError indicating that Input shape must be a positive integer.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**
## Response

Let's go through each of the input-output pairs given in the table one by one:


### Input 1:
```
shape=3
dtype=int
order='C'
```

Here, the function call will create a 2D array with a shape of (3,3) and all elements will be of int data type. The method of array creation will be row-major, that is arrays are filled row-wise in C-type order.

**Step 1:** 
```
np.ones(shape=shape, dtype=dtype, order=order)
```
This creates a 2D array of the given shape and data type. It will create a 2D array that looks like: 

```
array([[1, 1, 1],
       [1, 1, 1],
       [1, 1, 1]])
```

The 'ones' function will return this array as output. 

### Input 2:
    
```
shape=5, 
dtype=float, 
order='F'
```

Here, the function call will create a 2D array with a shape of (5,5) and all elements will be of float data type. The method of array creation will be column-major, that is arrays are filled column-wise in Fortran-type order.

**Step 1:** 

```
np.ones(shape=shape, dtype=dtype, order=order)
```

This creates a 2D array of the given shape and data type. It will create a 2D array that looks like: 

```
array([[1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
       [1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
       [1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
       [1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
       [1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]])
```

The 'ones' function will return this 2D array as output.

### Input 3:
    
```
shape=-3, 
dtype=bool, 
order=None
```

Here, the function call will try to create a 2D array with a shape of (-3,-3) which is not a positive integer. So, this input will raise a ValueError indicating that Input shape must be a positive integer.

**Step 1:**

if shape <= 0:
    raise ValueError("Input shape must be a positive integer.")


The input parameter 'shape' is negative, so the if-statement will raise an error with a message "Input shape must be a positive integer." without executing Step 2.

## Observations

For Data Flow, GPT provides appropriate reasoning along with calculations & their meaning.
For Control Flow, Chat GPT provides semantically correct code & the reasoning is also on point.
Interesting thing to note is that chatGPT explains everything with the help of matrix and what it signifies.
