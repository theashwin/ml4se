## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Input 1:
a = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40]), axis = 0, ddof = 0, nan_policy = 'propagate'

Calculation steps of zscore_control_new function for the given input:
1. Test if the given input 'a' is a numpy array or not using isinstance(a, np.ndarray). Since the input a = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40]) is a numpy array, the function proceeds with the next step.
2. Check if the size of the numpy array is 0 or not using a.size. Here the size of the numpy array is 4, so the function proceeds with the next step.
3. Calculate the arithmetic mean of the input numpy array for the 0th axis using np.mean(a, axis=axis). In this case, the mean is (10+20+30+40)/4 = 25.
4. Calculate the standard deviation of the input numpy array for the 0th axis using np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof). In this case, the standard deviation is sqrt(((10-25)^2+(20-25)^2+(30-25)^2+(40-25)^2)/4) = 12.9099444874
5. Calculate the z-score of the input numpy array using (a - mean) / std_dev. In this case, z-score array is [-1.34164079, -0.4472136,  0.4472136,  1.34164079]
6. Finally, the function returns the z-score array as output.

Input 2:
a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]]), axis = 1, ddof = 1, nan_policy = 'propagate'

Calculation steps of zscore_control_new function for the given input:
1. Test if the given input 'a' is a numpy array or not using isinstance(a, np.ndarray). Since the input a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]]) is a numpy array, the function proceeds with the next step.
2. Check if the size of the numpy array is 0 or not using a.size. Here the size of the numpy array is 4, so the function proceeds with the next step.
3. Calculate the arithmetic mean of the input numpy array for the 1st axis using np.mean(a, axis=axis). In this case, the mean along the 1st axis [1,2] and [3,4] is [1.5, 3.5].
4. Calculate the standard deviation of the input numpy array for the 1st axis with the ddof as 1 using np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof). In this case, the standard deviation along the 1st axis [1,2] and [3,4] with ddof as 1 is [(1/2) * sqrt(((1-1.5)^2 + (2-1.5)^2)/1), (1/2) * sqrt(((3-3.5)^2 + (4-3.5)^2)/1)] = [0.70710678, 0.70710678].
5. Calculate the z-score of the input numpy array using (a - mean) / std_dev. In this case, z-score array is [[-0.70710678, 0.70710678],[-0.70710678, 0.70710678]]
6. Finally, the function returns the z-score array as output.

Input 3:
a = np.array([]), axis = 0, ddof = 0, nan_policy = 'propagate'

Calculation steps of zscore_control_new function for the given input:
1. Test if the given input 'a' is a numpy array or not using isinstance(a, np.ndarray). Since the input a = np.array([]) is a numpy array, the function proceeds with the next step.
2. Check if the size of the numpy array is 0 or not using a.size. Here the size of the numpy array is 0, so the function returns "ValueError('Input array must not be empty')" as output.

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```


import numpy as np

def zscore_new(a, axis=0, ddof=0, nan_policy='propagate'):
    mean = np.mean(a, axis=axis)
    std_dev = np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof)
    zscore = np.divide(np.subtract(a, mean), std_dev)
    return zscore


```

## Response

Inputs:

| Input  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| a      | Input array |
| axis   | Axis along which to perform the z-score calculation. |
| ddof   | Delta Degrees of Freedom for adjusting the standard deviation estimation. |
| nan_policy | Determines how to handle the presence of NaN values in the input. | 

Outputs:

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| zscore | Z-score of the input along the specified axis. |

Steps:

1. Import numpy package.
2. Define a function 'zscore_new' which accepts four parameters 'a', 'axis', 'ddof', and 'nan_policy'.
3. Compute the mean of the input array 'a' along the specified 'axis' using the 'np.mean' function and store it in 'mean'.
4. Compute the standard deviation of the input array 'a' along the specified 'axis', with 'ddof' number of degrees of freedom using the 'np.std' function and store it in 'std_dev'.
5. Compute the z-score of the input array 'a' using the 'np.divide' and 'np.subtract' functions, and store it in 'zscore'.
6. Return the computed 'zscore'.
7. Test the function with appropriate inputs and check if it returns the expected output.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Input 1:
```
a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
axis = None
ddof = 1
nan_policy = 'raise'
```
Expected Output:
```
array([[-1.22474487,  0.        ,  1.22474487],
       [-1.22474487,  0.        ,  1.22474487]])
```

Calculation:

1. The mean of the input array along the axis 'None' is: 
```
mean = np.mean(a, axis=None)
mean = (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6
mean = 3.5
```
2. The standard deviation of the input array with ddof=1 and  along the axis 'None' is:
```
std_dev = np.std(a, axis=None, ddof=1)
std_dev = sqrt((1-3.5)^2+(2-3.5)^2+(3-3.5)^2+(4-3.5)^2+(5-3.5)^2+(6-3.5)^2)/sqrt(5)
std_dev = 1.87082869
```
3. The z-score of the input array is:
```
zscore = np.divide(np.subtract(a, mean), std_dev)
zscore = [[-1.33630621, -0.26726124,  0.80178373],
          [ 2.86970547,  3.73875044,  4.6077954 ]]
```

Reasoning:

1. The numpy package is imported at the beginning.
2. The input array 'a' is a list of lists and is passed as an argument to the function.
3. The specified value of 'axis' is 'None', which means the z-score calculated is of the entire array.
4. The value of 'ddof' is given as 1, which means it uses (n - 1) degrees of freedom as regular mode rather than n degrees of freedom.
5. As 'nan_policy' is 'raise', it raises an error if there are any NaN values in the input.
6. Mean and standard deviation are calculated using numpy 'np.mean' and 'np.std' functions respectively on array 'a' and 'axis' as 'None'.
7. Z-score is calculated using numpy 'np.divide' and 'np.subtract' functions on the array 'a', mean, std_dev.
8. The calculated z-score is returned.


Input 2:
```
a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
axis = 0
ddof = 0
nan_policy = 'propagate'
```
Expected Output:
```
array([[-1., -1., -1.],
       [ 1.,  1.,  1.]])
```

Calculation:

1. The mean of the input array along the axis '0' is: 
```
mean = np.mean(a, axis=0)
mean = [(1+4)/2, (2+5)/2, (3+6)/2]
mean = [2.5, 3.5, 4.5]
```
2. The standard deviation of the input array along the axis '0' is:
```
std_dev = np.std(a, axis=0)
std_dev = [sqrt((1-2.5)^2+(4-2.5)^2), sqrt((2-3.5)^2+(5-3.5)^2), sqrt((3-4.5)^2+(6-4.5)^2)]
std_dev = [1.5, 1.5, 1.5]
```
3. The z-score of the input array along the axis '0' is:
```
zscore = np.divide(np.subtract(a, mean), std_dev)
zscore = [[-1., -1., -1.],
          [ 1.,  1.,  1.]]
```

Reasoning:

1. In the second input, 'axis' is specified as 0 which means the calculation for z-score is done for each column in the input.
2. 'ddof' is set to 0, which means it uses n degrees of freedom while calculating.
3. As 'nan_policy' is 'propagate', any NaN values present in the input are propagated to the final output.
5. Mean and standard deviation are calculated using numpy 'np.mean' and 'np.std' functions respectively on array 'a' and 'axis' as 0.
6. Z-score is calculated using the numpy 'np.divide' and 'np.subtract' functions on the array 'a', mean, std_dev.
7. The calculated z-score is returned.


Input 3:
```
a = [1, 2, np.nan, 4]
axis = None
ddof = 1
nan_policy = 'omit'
```
Expected Output:
```
array([-1.34164079, -0.4472136,         np.nan,  0.89442719])
```

Calculation:

1. The 'nan_policy' is 'omit', So we remove any NaN values before calculation.
```
a = [1, 2, 4]
```
2. The mean of the input array along the axis 'None' is: 
```
mean = np.mean(a, axis=None)
mean = (1+2+4)/3
mean = 2.33333333
```
3. The standard deviation of the input array with ddof=1 and along the axis 'None' is:
```
std_dev = np.std(a, axis=None, ddof=1)
std_dev = sqrt(((1-2.333333)^2+(2-2.333333)^2+(4-2.333333)^2))/sqrt(2)
std_dev = 1.24721913
```
4. The z-score of the input array is:
```
zscore = np.divide(np.subtract([1, 2, np.nan, 4], mean), std_dev)
zscore = [-1.34164079, -0.4472136, np.nan, 0.89442719]
```

Reasoning:

1. In the third input, 'axis' is specified as None which means the calculation for z-score is done for the whole input array.
2. 'ddof' is set as 1 which means it uses n-1 degrees of freedom while calculating.
3. As 'nan_policy' is 'omit', any NaN values present in the input are omitted from the final output.
4. Before calculation, NaN will be removed from the input as it is specified as omit nan_policy and the remaining input is [1, 2, 4].
5. Mean and standard deviation are calculated using numpy 'np.mean' and 'np.std' functions respectively on array 'a' and 'axis' as None.
6. Z-score is calculated using the numpy 'np.divide' and 'np.subtract' functions on the array 'a', mean, std_dev.
7. The calculated z-score is returned.
