# Task 1: Data Control

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

def _var(x, axis=0, ddof=0, mean=None):
    # Calculate variance of sample, warning if precision is lost
    var = _moment(x, 2, axis, mean=mean)
    if ddof != 0:
        n = x.shape[axis] if axis is not None else x.size
        var *= np.divide(n, n-ddof)  
    return var

```

## Response

For the first version of the function, we will change the data flow. Instead of calculating the variance, we will calculate the standard deviation of the data. 

For the second version of the function, we will change the control flow. Instead of checking for ddof!=0, we will check if the input data has any negative values. If it has negative values, we will return a message asking the user to input positive values.

Here are the two new versions of the function:

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

Table

| Input | axis | ddof | mean | Output |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------ |
| [1, 2, 3] | 0 | 0 | None | 0.6666666666666666 |
| [-1, 2, 3] | 0 | 0 | None | "Input data should contain only positive values. Please correct your input." |
| [1, 2, 3] | 1 | 0 | None | [0., 0., 0.] |
                 
Explanation

1. The function name is `_var_input()`.
2. The function takes 4 input arguments:
   * `x`: List or array of input data.
   * `axis`: Axis or axes along which the variance is calculated. (0 by default)
   * `ddof`: Delta degrees of freedom (subtracting `ddof` from the number of variables). (0 by default)
   * `mean`: Mean value of `x`. (`None` by default)
3. If the input data contains any negative value, the function prints "Input data should contain only positive values. Please correct your input." and returns `None`.
4. If the input data contains only non-negative values, the function calculates the variance of the sample and returns the value.
5. If `ddof` is not equal to zero, the function adjusts the variance using the formula: `var = var * (n / (n - ddof))`, where `n` is the number of variables in the data along `axis`.
6. The execution of this function depends mainly on the input data. If the data contains any negative value, the function returns an error message. If the data contains only non-negative values, the function calculates the variance of the data and returns its value. If `ddof` is not zero, the function adjusts the variance using the given formula.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. `Input = [1, 2, 3], axis = 0, ddof = 0, mean = None`:

   * The input data `[1, 2, 3]` does not contain any negative value, so the function proceeds with the variance calculation.
   * The `_moment()` function is called with the inputs `x = [1, 2, 3], n = 3, a = 2, axis = 0, weights = None, returned = False, mean = None`. The function calculates the 2nd moment along the given axis (0).
   
     1. The values are first centered by subtracting the mean (which is None), resulting in `[-1., 0., 1.]`.
       
     2. The square of these centered values are taken, resulting in `[1., 0., 1.]`.
       
     3. The weighted average of these squares are calculated along the given axis (0), resulting in `0.6666666666666666`.
       
   * The function returns the variance value `0.6666666666666666`.
   
2. `Input = [-1, 2, 3], axis = 0, ddof = 0, mean = None`:

   * The input data `[-1, 2, 3]` contains a negative value (`-1`), so the function prints "Input data should contain only positive values. Please correct your input." and returns `None`.
   
3. `Input = [1, 2, 3], axis = 1, ddof = 0, mean = None`:

   * The input data `[1, 2, 3]` does not contain any negative value, so the function proceeds with the variance calculation.
   * The `_moment()` function is called with the inputs `x = [1, 2, 3], n = 3, a = 2, axis = 1, weights = None, returned = False, mean = None`. The function calculates the 2nd moment along the given axis (1).
   
     1. The values are first centered by subtracting the mean (which is None), resulting in `[[1., 0., -1.]]`.
       
     2. The square of these centered values are taken, resulting in `[[1., 0., 1.]]`.
       
     3. The weighted average of these squares are calculated along the given axis (1), resulting in `[0., 0., 0.]`.
    
   * The function returns the variance values `[0., 0., 0.]`.
   
In conclusion, the function calculates the variance of the input data along the given axis (default is 0) and adjusts the calculated variance based on the value of `ddof`, if required. If the input data contains negative values, the function will print an error message and return `None`.

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```


def _var_std(x, axis=0, ddof=0, mean=None):
    # Calculate standard deviation of sample, warning if precision is lost
    std = np.sqrt(_moment(x, 2, axis, mean=mean))
    if ddof != 0:
        n = x.shape[axis] if axis is not None else x.size
        std *= np.divide(n, n-ddof)  
    return std


```

## Response

Table:

| Input | axis | ddof | mean | Output |
|-------|------|------|------|--------|
| x = [1, 2, 3, 4] | 0 | 0 | None | 1.118033988749895 |
| x = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] | 1 | 1 | None | [0.70710678, 0.70710678] |
| x = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] | None | 0 | [2, 3] | [0.70710678, 0.70710678] |

**Execution of the function:**

1. The function _var_std takes in 4 parameters: x, axis, ddof, and mean.
2. It calculates the standard deviation of a sample using the _moment function with a second order moment. It takes in x and the given axis. If a mean value is also given it will be passed on to the _moment function calling. The result is stored in a variable std.
3. If the value of ddof is not 0, it calculates the required factor using np.divide() function and update the value of std accordingly.
4. The final value of std is returned by the function to the caller.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. **Input: x = [1, 2, 3, 4], axis = 0, ddof = 0, mean = None**

   - _moment(x, 2, axis, mean) will be called with x = [1, 2, 3, 4], axis = 0, and mean = None. The _moment function will calculate the second-order moment of the array x along axis 0 and return 7.5.
   
   - The np.sqrt function will be used to compute the square root of 7.5 which is approximately 2.7386.
   
   - ddof is 0, so no further calculations will be performed.
    
   - The final result is 2.7386 which is returned as the output of the function.
   
2. **Input: x = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], axis = 1, ddof = 1, mean = None**

   - _moment(x, 2, axis, mean) will be called with x = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], axis = 1 and mean = None. The _moment function will calculate the second-order moment of the array x along axis 1 and return [0.25, 0.25].
   
   - The np.sqrt function will be used to compute the square root of [0.25, 0.25] which is [0.5, 0.5].
   
   - Since ddof is 1, 1 is subtracted from the number of observations along the axis, which in this case is 2. So the array [2, 2] is computed.
   
   - The two arrays [0.5, 0.5] and [2, 2] are divided element-wise using the np.divide() function to get [0.25, 0.25].
    
   - The final result is [0.25, 0.25] which is returned as the output of the function.

3. **Input: x = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], axis = None, ddof = 0, mean = [2, 3]**

   - _moment(x, 2, axis, mean) will be called with x = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], axis = None, and mean = [2, 3]. The _moment function will calculate the second-order moment of the array x and return 1.25.
   
   - The np.sqrt function will be used to compute the square root of 1.25 which is approximately 1.118.
   
   - Since axis is None, the size of x (number of elements in x) will be used to calculate the number of observations along the axis, which is 4. So the denominator in the np.divide() function will be 4-0 = 4.
   
   - The final result is 1.118 which is returned as the output of the function.
