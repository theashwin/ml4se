# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

def sem(a, axis=0, ddof=1, nan_policy='propagate'):
    n = a.shape[axis]
    s = np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof) / np.sqrt(n)
    return s

```

## Response

Version 1: Change data flow

One way to change the data flow of the given function is to replace the division of the standard deviation by the square root of the number of elements with a multiplication of the standard deviation by the reciprocal of the square root of the number of elements. This can help improve the efficiency of the function since dividing is generally more computationally expensive than multiplying. Here's the modified code:

```
import numpy as np

def new_sem(a, axis=0, ddof=1, nan_policy='propagate'):
    n = a.shape[axis]
    s = np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof) * 1 / np.sqrt(n)
    return s
```

Version 2: Change control flow

One way to change the control flow of the given function is to add a conditional statement that checks if there are any NaN values in the input array. If there are NaN values, the function returns a message indicating that the array contains NaN values. Otherwise, the function proceeds with the original calculation. Here's the modified code:

```
import numpy as np

def new_sem(a, axis=0, ddof=1, nan_policy='propagate'):
    if np.isnan(np.sum(a)):
        return 'Input array contains NaN values'
    else:
        n = a.shape[axis]
        s = np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof) / np.sqrt(n)
        return s
```

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

## Response

Here are the modified functions enclosed in the requested tags:

```
<DATA>
import numpy as np

def new_sem(a, axis=0, ddof=1, nan_policy='propagate'):
    n = a.shape[axis]

    return s
</DATA>

    else:
        n = a.shape[axis]
        s = np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof) / np.sqrt(n)
        return s
</CONTROL>
```

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```


import numpy as np

def new_sem(a, axis=0, ddof=1, nan_policy='propagate'):
    if np.isnan(np.sum(a)):
        return 'Input array contains NaN values'
    else:
        n = a.shape[axis]
        s = np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof) / np.sqrt(n)
        return s


```

## Response

Inputs:
1. a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]; axis=0; ddof=1; nan_policy='propagate'
2. a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]; axis=1; ddof=1; nan_policy='propagate'
3. a = [[1,np.nan,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9],[10,11,12]]; axis=2; ddof=1; nan_policy='omit'

| Inputs | Outputs | 
| --- | --- |
| a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]; axis=0; ddof=1; nan_policy='propagate' | [2.44948974 2.44948974 2.44948974] |
| a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]; axis=1; ddof=1; nan_policy='propagate' | [0.81649658 0.81649658 0.81649658] |
| a = [[1,np.nan,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9],[10,11,12]]; axis=2; ddof=1; nan_policy='omit' | "Input array contains NaN values" |

Function execution:

1. In the first input scenario:
    - The function takes the input 2D array 'a' with axis=0 (that is, it computes the standard error of the means along columns), ddof=1 for delta degrees of freedom equal to 1, and nan_policy='propagate'.
    - The function first checks if there are any NaN values in the input array by checking if the sum of the array using np.sum(a) contains NaN values as np.isnan(np.sum(a)). Since np.isnan(np.sum(a)) returns False, the function proceeds.
    - The function then calculates the number of data points, n, which is 3 in this case because there are three columns in the input array.
    - The function then calculates the standard deviation of the input array along the given axis (axis=0) using the np.std() function which takes axis=0 (i.e. it computes the standard deviation along columns) and ddof=1 for delta degrees of freedom equal to 1. 
    - The function then divides the resulting standard deviation by the square root of the number of data points, n, and returns the resulting array [2.44948974 2.44948974 2.44948974].

2. In the second input scenario:
    - The function takes the input 2D array 'a' with axis=1 (that is, it computes the standard error of the means along rows), ddof=1 for delta degrees of freedom equal to 1, and nan_policy='propagate'.
    - The function first checks if there are any NaN values in the input array by checking if the sum of the array using np.sum(a) contains NaN values as np.isnan(np.sum(a)). Since np.isnan(np.sum(a)) returns False, the function proceeds.
    - The function then calculates the number of data points, n, which is 3 in this case because there are three rows in the input array.
    - The function then calculates the standard deviation of the input array along the given axis (axis=1) using the np.std() function which takes axis=1 (i.e. it computes the standard deviation along rows) and ddof=1 for delta degrees of freedom equal to 1. 
    - The function then divides the resulting standard deviation by the square root of the number of data points, n, and returns the resulting array [0.81649658 0.81649658 0.81649658].

3. In the third input scenario:
    - The function takes the input 2D array 'a' with axis=2 (that is, it computes the standard error of the means along the depths), ddof=1 for delta degrees of freedom equal to 1, and nan_policy='omit'.
    - The function first checks if there are any NaN values in the input array by checking if the sum of the array using np.sum(a) contains NaN values as np.isnan(np.sum(a)). Since the input array contains NaN values (np.nan), the function directly returns the string "Input array contains NaN values".

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. For input a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] with axis=0, ddof=1, nan_policy='propagate':

- The function checks if the input array contains NaN values or not using the 'np.isnan(np.sum(a))' expression. In this case, the sum of the elements in the input array is a finite number and does not contain any NaN values, so the 'if' condition fails and the function execution continues.

```
if np.isnan(np.sum(a)):
    return 'Input array contains NaN values'
```

- The shape of the input array is (3,3). The number of data points, n, is the size of axis=0, so n = 3.

```
n = a.shape[axis]
```

- The 'np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof)' expression calculates the standard deviation of the input array along the column axis, with the delta degrees of freedom set to 1 ('ddof=1'). 

```
s = np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof)
```

- The calculated standard deviation array is [2.82842712 2.82842712 2.82842712]. The 's / np.sqrt(n)' expression then calculates the standard error of the mean for each column by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of n.

```
s = np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof) / np.sqrt(n)
```

- The final standard error of the mean array is [2.44948974 2.44948974 2.44948974], which is returned as the output.

```
return s
```

2. For input a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] with axis=1, ddof=1, nan_policy='propagate':

- The function first checks if there are any NaN values in the input array using 'np.isnan(np.sum(a))'. Since there are no NaN values in the input array, the execution proceeds.

```
if np.isnan(np.sum(a)):
    return 'Input array contains NaN values'
```

- The 'n' variable is calculated as the number of rows in the input array which is 3.

```
n = a.shape[axis]
```

- The 'np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof)' expression calculates the standard deviation of the input array along the row axis, with delta degrees of freedom equal to 1.

```
s = np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof)
```

- The function then calculates the standard error of the mean for each of the three elements in the row by dividing the 's' array by the square root of 'n' using 's / np.sqrt(n)'. The resulting array is [0.81649658 0.81649658 0.81649658].

```
s = np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof) / np.sqrt(n)
```

- This array is returned as the output.

```
return s
```

3. For input a = [[1,np.nan,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9],[10,11,12]] with axis=2, ddof=1, nan_policy='omit':

- The function first checks if there are any NaN values in the input array using 'np.isnan(np.sum(a))'. Since the input array contains NaN values (np.nan), the execution of the function is aborted and the function returns the string 'Input array contains NaN values'.

```
if np.isnan(np.sum(a)):
    return 'Input array contains NaN values'
```

- Since the function returns the above string without executing further, there are no intermediate calculations performed in this case.

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```


import numpy as np

def new_sem(a, axis=0, ddof=1, nan_policy='propagate'):
    n = a.shape[axis]
    s = np.std(a, axis=axis, ddof=ddof) * 1 / np.sqrt(n)
    return s


```

## Response

Inputs:

| Input | Variable Type | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| data  | numpy array  | np.array([1,2,3,4]) |
| axis  | integer | 0 |
| ddof  | integer | 2 |

Outputs:

| Output | Variable Type | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| s | float | 0.957 |

Execution:

The function takes in a numpy array, an axis, ddof, and nan_policy as arguments. The numpy array is passed to the function and its shape is determined on the specified axis. The standard deviation of the array is then calculated along the specified axis using ddof=1. The equation S = std(axis) * 1 / sqrt(n) is used to calculate the newSEM (standard error of the mean). The calculated newSEM is then returned as the output.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Input 1:

| Input | Value |
|-------|-------|
| a | np.array([1,2,3,4]) |
| axis | 0 |
| ddof | 1 |
| nan_policy | 'propagate' |

Output 1:

| Output | Value |
|--------|-------|
| s | 0.645 |

Execution 1:

The shape of the input numpy array is (4,) since it is a 1-dimensional array. The function calculates the standard deviation of the input array along the 0 axis using ddof value of 1. To compute standard deviation, the function subtracts the mean of the input array from each element, squares the result, takes the mean of the squared differences and returns the square root of this value. The mean of the input array is (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5. The differences of each element from this mean are [-1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5]. Squaring these values gives [2.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25]. The mean of these values is 1.25 and the square root of this value is 1.118. Multiplying this by 1/sqrt(n) where n is the size of the input array (4), gives the output value of 0.645.

Input 2:

| Input | Value |
|-------|-------|
| a | np.array([1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8]) |
| axis | 1 |
| ddof | 1 |
| nan_policy | 'propagate' |

Output 2:

| Output | Value |
|--------|-------|
| s | [1.118, 1.118] |

Execution 2:

The shape of the input numpy array is (2,4). The function calculates the standard deviation of each sub-array along the 1 axis using ddof value of 1. For the sub-array [1,2,3,4], the mean is 2.5, and the differences of each element from this mean are [-1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5]. Squaring these values gives [2.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25]. The mean of these values is 1.25 and the square root of this value is 1.118. Multiplying this by 1/sqrt(n) where n is the size of the sub-array (4), gives the output value of 1.118. The same procedure is followed for the sub-array [5,6,7,8] giving the output [1.118, 1.118].

Input 3:

| Input | Value |
|-------|-------|
| a | np.array([1,2,3,4]) |
| axis | None |
| ddof | 2 |
| nan_policy | 'propagate' |

Output 3:

| Output | Value |
|--------|-------|
| s | 0.801 |

Execution 3:

The shape of the input numpy array is (4,) since it is a 1-dimensional array. The function calculates the standard deviation of the flattened/1D input array with ddof value of 2 as no axis is specified. The mean of the input array is (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5. The differences of each element from this mean are [-1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5]. Squaring these values gives [2.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25]. The sum of these values is 5 and the length of the input array is 4. Hence, the variance of the input array is 5/2 = 2.5. The square root of this variance multiplied by 1/sqrt(n) where n is the length of the input array (4) gives the output value of 0.801.
