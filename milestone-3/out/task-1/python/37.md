def cumfreq(a, numbins=10, defaultreallimits=None, weights=None):
    h, l, b, e = _histogram(a, numbins, defaultreallimits, weights=weights)

# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

def cumfreq(a, numbins=10, defaultreallimits=None, weights=None):
    h, l, b, e = _histogram(a, numbins, defaultreallimits, weights=weights)
    cumhist = np.cumsum(h * 1, axis=0)
    return CumfreqResult(cumhist, l, b, e)

```

## Response

One version with changed data flow could be:

```
def cumfreq_v1(a, numbins=10, defaultreallimits=None, weights=None):
    h, _, _, _ = _histogram(a, numbins, defaultreallimits, weights=weights)
    cumhist = np.cumsum(h * 1, axis=0)
    return cumhist
```

In this version, I removed the arguments `l`, `b`, and `e` from the `CumfreqResult` function, which were not used anyway, and directly returned the `cumhist` array.

One version with changed control flow could be:

```
def cumfreq_v2(a, numbins=10, defaultreallimits=None, weights=None):
    h, l, b, e = _histogram(a, numbins, defaultreallimits, weights=weights)
    cumhist = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(h)):
        cumhist.append(h[i] + cumhist[i-1])
    l.append(l[-1])
    b.append(b[-1])
    e.append(e[-1])
    return CumfreqResult(np.array(cumhist), l, b, e)
```

In this version, I used a `for` loop to create the cumulative frequency histogram, instead of using `np.cumsum()`. I also appended the last value of `l`, `b`, and `e` to their respective arrays to match the length of `cumhist`.

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

`<DATA>`
```python
def cumfreq_v1(a, numbins=10, defaultreallimits=None, weights=None):
    h, _, _, _ = _histogram(a, numbins, defaultreallimits, weights=weights)
    cumhist = np.cumsum(h * 1, axis=0)
    return cumhist
</DATA>
```

`<CONTROL>`
```python
def cumfreq_v2(a, numbins=10, defaultreallimits=None, weights=None):
    h, l, b, e = _histogram(a, numbins, defaultreallimits, weights=weights)

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```python

    l.append(l[-1])
    b.append(b[-1])
    e.append(e[-1])
    return CumfreqResult(np.array(cumhist), l, b, e)
```

## Response

| Input | Function Output |
|-------|-------------------|
| a=[1,2,3,4,5,6], numbins=2, defaultreallimits=None, weights=None | CumfreqResult(np.array([3,6]), [1, 3.5, 6], [1, 3.5, 6], [1, 3.5, 6]) |
| a=[1,2,3,4,5,6], numbins=3, defaultreallimits=(0,8), weights=None | CumfreqResult(np.array([1, 3, 6]), [0, 2.6666666666666665, 5.333333333333333], [0, 2.6666666666666665, 5.333333333333333, 8], [0, 2, 4, 6]) |
| a=[1,2,3,4,5,6], numbins=2, defaultreallimits=None, weights=[1,1,1,1,1,1] | CumfreqResult(np.array([3, 6]), [1, 3.5, 6], [1, 3.5, 6], [1, 3.5, 6])   |

- In input 1, the function would count the frequency for values in bins `[1, 3.5)` and `[3.5, 6]`. It would then calculate the cumulative frequency based on these frequency counts. Finally, it would append to the lists `l`, `b` and `e` the limits for the last bin, which would be the maximum value in the list (6). The CumfreqResult named tuple, containing the cumulative histogram, limits and bins would be returned.

- In input 2, the function would count the frequency for values in bins `[0, 2.67)`, `[2.67, 5.33)` and `[5.33, 8]`. It would then calculate the cumulative frequency based on these frequency counts. Finally, it would append to the lists `l`, `b` and `e` the limits for the last value of their respective lists. The CumfreqResult named tuple, containing the cumulative histogram, limits and bins would be returned.

- In input 3, the function would assign weights to each value and use them to count the frequency for values in bins `[1, 3.5)` and `[3.5, 6]`. It would then calculate the cumulative frequency based on these frequency counts. Finally, it would append to the lists `l`, `b` and `e` the limits for the last value of their respective lists. The CumfreqResult named tuple, containing the cumulative histogram, limits and bins would be returned.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

#### Input 1:
```python
a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
numbins=2
defaultreallimits=None
weights=None
```

- The function is called using the above input values.
- The `_histogram` helper function is called with arguments `(a,numbins,defaultreallimits,weights)`. So, the histogram of the data is computed with bins `[1, 3.5)` and `[3.5, 6]`.
- The function now creates an empty list `cumhist` to store the cumulative frequency of the data.
- The function then runs a loop from index 1 to the length of the histogram list, calculating the cumulative frequency of each bin. These cumulative frequencies are added to `cumhist`.
- The function then appends the limit for the last bin's end point `6` to lists `l`, `b`, and `e`.
- Finally, the function returns a `CumfreqResult` named tuple with arrays for cumulative histogram, limits of classes and bins.

The frequency counts for each bin are as follows and `np.cumsum` is used to compute the cumulative histogram:

| Bin                 | Frequency |
|---------------------|------|
| `[1, 3.5)`           | 3    |
| `[3.5, 6]`           | 3    |

```python
# frequency counts
h = [3, 3]
# boundaries of each bin
b = [1, 3.5, 6]
# mid points of each bin 
l = [1, 3.5, 6]
# endpoints of each bin without the last one
e = [1, 3.5]
# we compute cumulative histogram
cumhist = np.cumsum(h) = [3, 6]
```
So, the output of the function is:

```python
CumfreqResult(np.array([3, 6]), [1, 3.5, 6], [1, 3.5, 6], [1, 3.5, 6])
```


#### Input 2:
```python
a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
numbins=3
defaultreallimits=(0,8)
weights=None
```

- The function is called using the above input values.
- The `_histogram` helper function is called with arguments `(a,numbins,defaultreallimits,weights)`. So, the histogram of the data is computed with bins `[0,2.67)`, `[2.67,5.33)` and `[5.33, 8]`.
- The function now creates an empty list `cumhist` to store the cumulative frequency of the data.
- The function then runs a loop from index 1 to the length of the histogram list, calculating the cumulative frequency of each bin. These cumulative frequencies are added to `cumhist`.
- The function then appends the last endpoint of the bins `(8)` to lists `l`, `b`, and `e`.
- Finally, the function returns a `CumfreqResult` named tuple with arrays for cumulative histogram, limits of classes and bins.

The frequency counts for each bin are as follows and `np.cumsum` is used to compute the cumulative histogram:

| Bin               | Frequency |
|----------------------|------|
| `[0, 2.67)`           | 1    |
| `[2.67, 5.33)`        | 2    |
| `[5.33, 8]`           | 3    |

```python
# frequency counts
h = [1, 2, 3]
# boundaries of each bin
b = [0, 2.67, 5.33, 8]
# mid points of each bin 
l = [0, 2.67, 5.33, 8]
# endpoints of each bin without the last one
e = [0, 2.67, 5.33]
# we compute cumulative histogram
cumhist = np.cumsum(h) = [1, 3, 6]
```

So, the output of the function is:
```python
CumfreqResult(np.array([1, 3, 6]), [0, 2.67, 5.33, 8], [0, 2.67, 5.33, 8], [0, 2.67, 5.33, 8])
```


#### Input 3:

```python
a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
numbins=2
defaultreallimits=None
weights=[1,1,1,1,1,1]
```

- The function is called using the above input values.
- The `_histogram` helper function is called with arguments `(a,numbins,defaultreallimits,weights)`. The input data's bin boundaries are the same as input 1: `[1, 3.5)` and `[3.5, 6]`.
- The function now creates an empty list `cumhist` to store the cumulative frequency of the data.
- The function then runs a loop from index 1 to the length of the histogram list, calculating the cumulative frequency of each bin. These cumulative frequencies are added to `cumhist`.
- The function then appends the last endpoint of the bins `(6)` to lists `l`, `b`, and `e`.
- Finally, the function returns a `CumfreqResult` named tuple with arrays for cumulative histogram, limits of classes and bins.

The frequency counts for each bin are as follows and `np.cumsum` is used to compute the cumulative histogram:

| Bin                 | Frequency |
|---------------------|------|
| `[1, 3.5)`           | 3    |
| `[3.5, 6]`           | 3    |

```python
# frequency counts
h = [3, 3]
# boundaries of each bin
b = [1, 3.5, 6]
# mid points of each bin 
l = [1, 3.5, 6]
# endpoints of each bin without the last one
e = [1, 3.5]
# we compute cumulative histogram
cumhist = np.cumsum(h) = [3, 6]
```

So, the output of the function is:
```python
CumfreqResult(np.array([3, 6]), [1, 3.5, 6], [1, 3.5, 6], [1, 3.5, 6])
```

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

**Input 1**
- `a=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `numbins=2`
- `defaultreallimits=(1,5)`
- `weights=None`

**Output 1**
- `array([[2],[5]])`

**Execution 1**
- The input `a` contains 5 elements.
- The `numbins` parameter is set to 2, which means we want to divide the range of `a` into 2 equal bins.
- The `defaultreallimits` parameter is set to `(1,5)`, which means we want to ignore any data points in `a` that are outside the range `(1,5)`.
- The `weights` parameter is set to `None`, which means each data point has equal weight.
- The function `_histogram` takes these parameters and returns the following:
    - `h` = `array([2, 3])`
    - `_` = `array([1., 3., 5.])`
    - `__` = `array([1., 5.])`
    - `___` = `0`
- The variable `h` contains the histogram values for the 2 bins. The first bin contains 2 elements, and the second bin contains 3 elements.
- The statement `cumhist = np.cumsum(h * 1, axis=0)` calculates the cumulative histogram by taking the cumulative sum of the histogram values along axis 0. In this case, `cumhist` is `array([[2],[5]])`, which contains the cumulative sum of the histogram values for each bin.

**Input 2**
- `a=[20, 30, 10, 40, 50, 15]`
- `numbins=3`
- `defaultreallimits=(5,55)`
- `weights=[0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.3]`

**Output 2**
- `array([[0.5, 0.5, 0.6], [0.8, 0.8, 0.9], [1.1, 1.1, 2 ]])`

**Execution 2**
- The input `a` contains 6 elements.
- The `numbins` parameter is set to 3, which means we want to divide the range of `a` into 3 equal bins.
- The `defaultreallimits` parameter is set to `(5,55)`, which means we want to ignore any data points in `a` that are outside the range `(5,55)`.
- The `weights` parameter is set to `[0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.3]`, which means each data point has a certain weight.
- The function `_histogram` takes these parameters and returns the following:
    - `h` = `array([1, 2, 3])`
    - `_` = `array([ 5., 25., 45., 55.])`
    - `__` = `array([ 5., 25., 45.])`
    - `___` = `1`
- The variable `h` contains the histogram values for the 3 bins. The first bin contains 1 element, the second bin contains 2 elements, and the third bin contains 3 elements.
- The statement `cumhist = np.cumsum(h * 1, axis=0)` calculates the cumulative histogram by taking the cumulative sum of the histogram values along axis 0. In this case, `cumhist` is `array([[0.5, 0.5, 0.6], [0.8, 0.8, 0.9], [1.1, 1.1, 2 ]])`, which contains the cumulative sum of the histogram values for each bin.

**Input 3**
- `a=[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`
- `numbins=3`
- `defaultreallimits=(1,6)`
- `weights=None`

**Output 3**
- `array([[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[2,2,2]])`

**Execution 3**
- The input `a` is a 2x3 multi-dimensional array.
- The `numbins` parameter is set to 3, which means we want to divide the range of flattened `a` into 3 equal bins.
- The `defaultreallimits` parameter is set to `(1,6)`, which means we want to ignore any data points in flattened `a` that are outside the range `(1,6)`.
- The `weights` parameter is set to `None`, which means each data point has equal weight.
- The function `_histogram` is not designed to handle multi-dimensional input. Therefore, we flatten `a` to `[1,2,3,4,5,6]` and compute the histogram values:
    - `h` = `array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2])`
    - `_` = `array([1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6.])`
    - `__` = `array([1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6.])`
    - `___` = `0`
- The variable `h` contains the histogram values for the 3 bins. The first bin contains 1 element, the second bin contains 1 element, and the third bin contains 4 elements.
- The statement `cumhist = np.cumsum(h * 1, axis=0)` calculates the cumulative histogram by taking the cumulative sum of the histogram values along axis 0. In this case, `cumhist` is `array([[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[2,2,2]])`, which contains the cumulative sum of the histogram values for each bin.
