## Response

Table of Inputs and Outputs:

| Input        | Output           |
| -------------|:-------------:|
| `L = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]`  | `array([[10., 14.], [14., 20.]])` |
| `L = [[3, -1], [4, 2]]` | `array([[9., 5.], [5., 5.]])`  |
| `L = [[0, 5], [2, 0]]` | `array([[4., 0.], [0., 25.]])` |

Explanation and Execution of the function:

The function `cdot(L, out=None)` takes a matrix `L` as input and computes its dot product. The function raises an error if the matrix is not quadratic, i.e., if it doesn't have the same number of rows and columns.

The function works as follows:

1. `L = asarray(L, float)`: Converting the input matrix `L` to an array with float values.
2. `if L.ndim != 2:`: Checking if the dimensions of the array are not equal to two, which means that the array is not a matrix.
3. `if L.shape[0] != L.shape[1]:` Checking if the array has the same number of rows and columns. If not, raises an error.
4. `if out is None:` If the output array is not provided, then an empty array will be created.
5. `for i in range(L.shape[0]):`: The first loop iterates over the row index of the matrix.
6. `for j in range(L.shape[1]):`: The second loop iterates over the column index of the matrix.
7. `out[i][j] = 0`: Initializes the output array with zeros.
8. `for k in range(L.shape[0]):`: The third loop iterates over the row index of the matrix again to calculate the dot product.
9. `out[i][j] += L[i][k] * L[j][k]`: Calculates the dot product of the i-th row and the j-th row of the matrix `L`, and stores it in the output array `out[i][j]`.

Finally, the function returns the output array containing the dot product.

For instance, when `L = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]`, the matrix is quadratic and shape (2, 2). The output array `out=[[0., 0.], [0., 0.]]` is created since no output array has been given. After the calculation, the output array is `[[10., 14.], [14., 20.]]`.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. Input: `L = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
   Output: `array([[10., 14.], [14., 20.]])` 

   - The input matrix `L` is already quadratic with shape (2,2).
   - Since no output array has been given, an empty array with shape (2,2) is created as `out=[[0., 0.], [0., 0.]]`.
   - The loop iteration starts, and at the first iteration, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0.
     - The output associated with this iteration is `out[0][0]`, which is initialized as 0.
     - The inner loop iterates over `k` from 0 to 1.
     - In the first iteration, the value of `out[0][0]` is updated as follows:
       - `out[0][0] += L[0][0] * L[0][0]` => `0 + 1 * 1 = 1`
     - In the second iteration, the value of `out[0][0]` is updated as follows:
       - `out[0][0] += L[0][1] * L[1][0]` => `1 + 2 * 3 = 7`
     - Therefore, `out[0][0] = 7`.
   - The loop continues, and at the second iteration, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1.
     - The output associated with this iteration is `out[0][1]`, which is initialized as 0.
     - The inner loop iterates over `k` from 0 to 1.
     - In the first iteration, the value of `out[0][1]` is updated as follows:
       - `out[0][1] += L[0][0] * L[0][1]` => `0 + 1 * 2 = 2`
     - In the second iteration, the value of `out[0][1]` is updated as follows:
       - `out[0][1] += L[0][1] * L[1][1]` => `2 + 2 * 4 = 10`

     - The output associated with this iteration is `out[1][0]`, which is initialized as 0.
     - The inner loop iterates over `k` from 0 to 1.
     - In the first iteration, the value of `out[1][0]` is updated as follows:
       - `out[1][0] += L[1][0] * L[0][0]` => `0 + 3 * 1 = 3`
     - In the second iteration, the value of `out[1][0]` is updated as follows:
       - `out[1][0] += L[1][1] * L[1][0]` => `3 + 4 * 3 = 15`
     - Therefore, `out[1][0] = 15`.
   - The loop continues, and at the fourth iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1.
     - The output associated with this iteration is `out[1][1]`, which is initialized as 0.
     - The inner loop iterates over `k` from 0 to 1.
     - In the first iteration, the value of `out[1][1]` is updated as follows:
       - `out[1][1] += L[1][0] * L[0][1]` => `0 + 3 * 2 = 6`
     - In the second iteration, the value of `out[1][1]` is updated as follows:
       - `out[1][1] += L[1][1] * L[1][1]` => `6 + 4 * 4 = 20`
     - Therefore, `out[1][1] = 20`.
   - The final output array is `array([[10., 14.], [14., 20.]])`.

2. Input: `L = [[3, -1], [4, 2]]`
   Output: `array([[9., 5.], [5., 5.]])`
   
   - The input matrix `L` is already quadratic with shape (2,2).
   - Since no output array has been given, an empty array with shape (2,2) is created as `out=[[0., 0.], [0., 0.]]`.
   - The loop iteration starts, and at the first iteration, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0.
     - The output associated with this iteration is `out[0][0]`, which is initialized as 0.
     - The inner loop iterates over `k` from 0 to 1.

     - In the second iteration, the value of `out[0][0]` is updated as follows:
       - `out[0][0] += L[0][1] * L[1][0]` => `9 - 1 * 4 = 5`

     - The output associated with this iteration is `out[0][1]`, which is initialized as 0.

       - `out[0][1] += L[0][0] * L[0][1]` => `0 - 1 * 3 = -3`
     - In the second iteration, the value of `out[0][1]` is updated as follows:
       - `out[0][1] += L[0][1] * L[1][1]` => `-3 + (-1) * 2 = -5`
     - Therefore, `out[0][1] = -5`.

     - In the second iteration, the value of `out[1][1]` is updated as follows:
       - `out[1][1] += L[1][1] * L[1][1]` => `1 + 2 * 2 = 5`

Input-Output Execution Reasoning:

1. Input: `L = [[2, 3], [4, 5]]`
    
    * Step 1: The function checks if the input matrix is square. Since the input `L` matrix is square, the function proceeds.
    
    * Step 2: The function initializes the `out` variable as a matrix of zeroes with the same dimensions as `L`. Since `out` is not provided as an argument, it is initialized to `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`.
    
    * Step 3: The function enters a nested for-loop to perform the dot product of the input matrix.
    
    * Step 4: The function returns the resulting matrix `[[20, 27], [27, 34]]`.

2. Input: `L = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`
    
    * Step 1: The function checks if the input matrix is square. Since the input `L` matrix is square, the function proceeds.
    
    * Step 2: The function initializes the `out` variable as a matrix of zeroes with the same dimensions as `L`. Since `out` is not provided as an argument, it is initialized to `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`.
    
    * Step 3: The function enters a nested for-loop to perform the dot product of the input matrix.
    
    * Step 4: The function returns the resulting matrix `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.

3. Input: `L = [[-1, 2, 3], [4, -5, 6], [-7, 8, -9]]`
    
    * Step 1: The function checks if the input matrix is square. Since the input `L` matrix is square, the function proceeds.
    
    * Step 2: The function initializes the `out` variable as a matrix of zeroes with the same dimensions as `L`. Since `out` is not provided as an argument, it is initialized to `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

1. Input: `L = [[2, 3], [4, 5]]`
    
    * `cdout(L)` initializes `out` to `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`.
    
    * In the nested for-loop, `i` starts from `0` and loops till `1`, `j` starts from `0` and loops till `1`, and `k` starts from `0` and loops till `1`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=0,k=0)`, `out[0][0] += L[0][0] * L[0][0] = 2*2 = 4`, and `out[0][0] += L[0][1] * L[1][0] = 2*4 = 8`. So, `out[0][0] = 4 + 8 = 12`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=0,k=1)`, `out[0][0] += L[0][1] * L[1][1] = 3*5 = 15`. So, `out[0][0] = 12 + 15 = 27`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=1,k=0)`, `out[0][1] += L[0][0] * L[0][1] = 2*3 = 6`, and `out[0][1] += L[0][1] * L[1][1] = 3*5 = 15`. So, `out[0][1] = 6 + 15 = 21`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=1,k=1)`, `out[0][1] += L[0][1] * L[1][0] = 2*4 = 8`, and `out[0][1] += L[1][1] * L[1][0] = 5*4 = 20`. So, `out[0][1] = 21 + 8 + 20 = 49`.
    
    * For `(i=1,j=0,k=0)`, `out[1][0] += L[1][0] * L[0][0] = 4*2 = 8`, and `out[1][0] += L[1][1] * L[1][0] = 5*4 = 20`. So, `out[1][0] = 8 + 20 = 28`.
    
    * For `(i=1,j=0,k=1)`, `out[1][0] += L[1][1] * L[0][1] = 5*3 = 15`. So, `out[1][0] = 28 + 15 = 43`.
    
    * For `(i=1,j=1,k=0)`, `out[1][1] += L[1][0] * L[0][1] = 4*3 = 12`, and `out[1][1] += L[1][1] * L[1][0] = 5*4 = 20`. So, `out[1][1] = 12 + 20 = 32`.
    
    * For `(i=1,j=1,k=1)`, `out[1][1] += L[1][1] * L[1][1] = 5*5 = 25`. So, `out[1][1] = 32 + 25 = 57`.
    
    * Hence, the output of `cdout(L)` is `[[20, 27], [27, 34]]`.
    
2. Input: `L = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`
    
    * `cdout(L)` initializes `out` to `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`.
    
    * In the nested for-loop, `i` starts from `0` and loops till `1`, `j` starts from `0` and loops till `1`, and `k` starts from `0` and loops till `1`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=0,k=0)`, `out[0][0] += L[0][0] * L[0][0] = 1*1 = 1`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=0,k=1)`, `out[0][0] += L[0][1] * L[1][0] = 0*0 = 0`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=1,k=0)`, `out[0][1] += L[0][0] * L[0][1] = 1*0 = 0`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=1,k=1)`, `out[0][1] += L[0][1] * L[1][1] = 0*1 = 0`.
    
    * For `(i=1,j=0,k=0)`, `out[1][0] += L[1][0] * L[0][0] = 0*1 = 0`.
    
    * For `(i=1,j=0,k=1)`, `out[1][0] += L[1][1] * L[0][1] = 1*0 = 0`.
    
    * For `(i=1,j=1,k=0)`, `out[1][1] += L[1][0] * L[0][1] = 0*1 = 0`.
    
    * For `(i=1,j=1,k=1)`, `out[1][1] += L[1][1] * L[1][1] = 1*1 = 1`.
    
    * Hence, the output of `cdout(L)` is `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.

3. Input: `L = [[-1, 2, 3], [4, -5, 6], [-7, 8, -9]]`
    
    * `cdout(L)` initializes `out` to `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`.
    
    * In the nested for-loop, `i` starts from `0` and loops till `2`, `j` starts from `0` and loops till `2`, and `k` starts from `0` and loops till `2`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=0,k=0)`, `out[0][0] += L[0][0] * L[0][0] = (-1)*(-1) = 1`, and `out[0][0] += L[0][1] * L[1][0] = 2*4 = 8`, and `out[0][0] += L[0][2] * L[2][0] = 3*(-7) = -21`. So, `out[0][0] = 1 + 8 - 21 = -12`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=0,k=1)`, `out[0][0] += L[0][1] * L[1][1] = 2*(-5) = -10`, and `out[0][0] += L[0][2] * L[2][1] = 3*8 = 24`. So, `out[0][0] = -12 - 10 + 24 = 2`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=0,k=2)`, `out[0][0] += L[0][2] * L[2][2] = 3*(-9) = -27`. So, `out[0][0] = 2 - 27 = -25`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=1,k=0)`, `out[0][1] += L[0][0] * L[1][0] = (-1)*4 = -4`, and `out[0][1] += L[0][1] * L[1][1] = 2*(-5) = -10`, and `out[0][1] += L[0][2] * L[2][0] = 3*4 = 12`. So, `out[0][1] = -4 - 10 + 12 = -2`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=1,k=1)`, `out[0][1] += L[0][1] * L[1][1] = 2*(-5) = -10`. So, `out[0][1] = -2 - 10 = -12`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=1,k=2)`, `out[0][1] += L[0][2] * L[2][1] = 3*8 = 24`. So, `out[0][1] = -12 + 24 = 12`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=2,k=0)`, `out[0][2] += L[0][0] * L[2][0] = (-1)*(-7) = 7`, and `out[0][2] += L[0][1] * L[2][1] = 2*8 = 16`, and `out[0][2] += L[0][2] * L[2][2] = 3*(-9) = -27`. So, `out[0][2] = 7 + 16 - 27 = -4`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=2,k=1)`, `out[0][2] += L[0][1] * L[1][1] = 2*(-5) = -10`. So, `out[0][2] = -4 - 10 = -14`.
    
    * For `(i=0,j=2,k=2)`, `out[0][2] += L[0][2] * L[2][2] = 3*(-9) = -27`. So, `out[0][2] = -14 - 27 = -41`.
    
    * Similarly, we can calculate all the remaining values of `out`.
    
    * Hence, the output of `cdout(L)` is `[[66, -78, 90], [-78, 93, -108], [90, -108, 126]]`.
