def pointbiserialr(x, y):

# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

def pointbiserialr(x, y):
    rpb, prob = pearsonr(x, y)
    res = SignificanceResult(rpb, prob)
    res.correlation = rpb
    return res

```

## Response

Modified Code 1: 

In this version of the code, we are changing the data flow by replacing the `pearsonr` function with the `spearmanr` function from scipy.stats library.

```
# import spearmanr from scipy.stats library
from scipy.stats import spearmanr

# define a new pointbiserialr function with same signature
def pointbiserialr_v1(x, y):
    # calculate spearman correlation coefficient and p-value
    rsp, prob = spearmanr(x, y)
    # create new SignificanceResult object with spearman correlation coefficient and p-value
    res = SignificanceResult(rsp, prob)
    # set the correlation property to spearman correlation coefficient
    res.correlation = rsp
    # return the new SignificanceResult object
    return res
```

Modified Code 2: 

In this version of the code, we are changing the control flow by adding a conditional statement to return different messages based on the value of correlation coefficient.

```
# define a new pointbiserialr function with same signature
def pointbiserialr_v2(x, y):
    # calculate pearson correlation coefficient and p-value
    rpb, prob = pearsonr(x, y)
    # create new SignificanceResult object with pearson correlation coefficient and p-value
    res = SignificanceResult(rpb, prob)
    # set the correlation property to pearson correlation coefficient
    res.correlation = rpb
    # return 'There is a positive correlation' if correlation coefficient is greater than 0
    if rpb > 0:
        return 'There is a positive correlation'
    # return 'There is a negative correlation' if correlation coefficient is less than 0
    elif rpb < 0:
        return 'There is a negative correlation'
    # return 'There is no correlation' if correlation coefficient is equal to 0
    else:
        return 'There is no correlation'
```

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

## Response

Mutated Code 1: 

Here is the `pointbiserialr_v1` function with modified data flow, enclosed in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags:

```
<DATA>
# import spearmanr from scipy.stats library
from scipy.stats import spearmanr

# define a new pointbiserialr function with same signature
def pointbiserialr_v1(x, y):
    # calculate spearman correlation coefficient and p-value
    rsp, prob = spearmanr(x, y)
    # create new SignificanceResult object with spearman correlation coefficient and p-value
    res = SignificanceResult(rsp, prob)
    # set the correlation property to spearman correlation coefficient
    res.correlation = rsp
    # return the new SignificanceResult object
    return res
</DATA>
```

Mutated Code 2: 

Here is the `pointbiserialr_v2` function with modified control flow, enclosed in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags:

```
<CONTROL>
# define a new pointbiserialr function with same signature
def pointbiserialr_v2(x, y):
    # calculate pearson correlation coefficient and p-value
    rpb, prob = pearsonr(x, y)
    # create new SignificanceResult object with pearson correlation coefficient and p-value
    res = SignificanceResult(rpb, prob)
    # set the correlation property to pearson correlation coefficient
    res.correlation = rpb
    # return 'There is a positive correlation' if correlation coefficient is greater than 0
    if rpb > 0:
        return 'There is a positive correlation'
    # return 'There is a negative correlation' if correlation coefficient is less than 0
    elif rpb < 0:
        return 'There is a negative correlation'
    # return 'There is no correlation' if correlation coefficient is equal to 0
    else:
        return 'There is no correlation'
</CONTROL>
```
