# Task 1: Data Control

---

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

def _mad_1d(x, center, nan_policy):
    # Median absolute deviation for 1-d array x.
    # This is a helper function for `median_abs_deviation`; it assumes its
    # arguments have been validated already.  In particular,  x must be a
    # 1-d numpy array, center must be callable, and if nan_policy is not
    # 'propagate', it is assumed to be 'omit', because 'raise' is handled
    # in `median_abs_deviation`.
    # No warning is generated if x is empty or all nan.
    isnan = np.isnan(x)
    if isnan.any():
        if nan_policy == 'propagate':
            return np.nan
        x = x[~isnan]
    if x.size == 0:
        # MAD of an empty array is nan.
        return np.nan
    # Edge cases have been handled, so do the basic MAD calculation.
    med = center(x)
    mad = np.median(np.abs(x - med))
    return mad

```

## Response

Here are the two modified functions: 

Version 1: Changed Dataflow 

In this version, we remove the use of numpy and replace it with a pure Python implementation of the median absolute deviation.

```
import math

def _mad_1d_v1(x, center, nan_policy):
  # helper function for median_abs_deviation
  if len(x) == 0:
      return math.nan
  x_sorted = sorted(x)
  median = center(x_sorted)
  deviations = [abs(val - median) for val in x_sorted]
  mad = center(deviations)
  return mad
``` 

Version 2: Changed Control Flow

In this version, we implement the same functionality of the original function while using a while loop instead of conditionals.

```
def _mad_1d_v2(x, center, nan_policy):
  # helper function for median_abs_deviation
  isnan = True
  while isnan:
    if np.isnan(x).any():
      if nan_policy == 'propagate':
        return np.nan
      x = x[~isnan]
    isnan = False
  
  size = False
  while size:
    if x.size == 0:
      return np.nan
    size = False

  # Edge cases have been handled, so do the basic MAD calculation.
  med = center(x)
  mad = np.median(np.abs(x - med))
  return mad
```

## Prompt

**Enclose the data flow mutated function in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` tags and control flow mutated function in `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags.**

## Response

Here are the modified functions enclosed in `<DATA>` `</DATA>` and `<CONTROL>` `</CONTROL>` tags respectively. 

```
<DATA>
import math

def _mad_1d_v1(x, center, nan_policy):
  # helper function for median_abs_deviation
  if len(x) == 0:
      return math.nan
  x_sorted = sorted(x)
  median = center(x_sorted)
  deviations = [abs(val - median) for val in x_sorted]
  mad = center(deviations)
  return mad
</DATA>
```

```
<CONTROL>
def _mad_1d_v2(x, center, nan_policy):
  # helper function for median_abs_deviation
  isnan = True
  while isnan:
    if np.isnan(x).any():
      if nan_policy == 'propagate':
        return np.nan
      x = x[~isnan]
    isnan = False
  
  size = False
  while size:
    if x.size == 0:
      return np.nan
    size = False

  # Edge cases have been handled, so do the basic MAD calculation.
  med = center(x)
  mad = np.median(np.abs(x - med))
  return mad
</CONTROL>
```

# Task 1: Reasoning for Control Flow Mutated Function

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```

```

## Response

The given code is incomplete and blank. Please provide the code to proceed.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

I apologize for the confusion in my previous message. As there is no code provided, I cannot generate the input-output table and the execution details. If you can provide the code, I will be happy to assist you further.
