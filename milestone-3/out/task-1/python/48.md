# Task 1: Data Control

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, generate two versions of the function. First, change the data flow of the function. Second, change the control flow of the function. It is fine to change the semantics of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Be as creative as possible. Return the generated functions.**

**code:**

```

def _calculate_winsorized_variance(a, g, axis):
    if g == 0:
        return _var(a, ddof=1, axis=axis)
    a_win = np.moveaxis(a, axis, -1)

    nans_indices = np.any(np.isnan(a_win), axis=-1)

    a_win[..., :g] = a_win[..., [g]]
    a_win[..., -g:] = a_win[..., [-g - 1]]

 
    var_win[nans_indices] = np.nan
    return var_win

```

## Response

Here are two possible solutions:

1. Dataflow version:
```
def _calculate_winsorized_variance_v1(a, g, axis):
    a_win = np.moveaxis(a, axis, -1)

    nans_indices = np.any(np.isnan(a_win), axis=-1)
    nan_sum = np.count_nonzero(nans_indices)
    nan_ratio = nan_sum / a.size

    if g == 0 or nan_ratio >= 0.5:
        return _var(a, ddof=1, axis=axis)

    a_win[..., :g] = a_win[..., [g]]
    a_win[..., -g:] = a_win[..., [-g - 1]]

    var_win = np.nanvar(a_win, axis=-1, ddof=1)
    var_win[nans_indices] = np.nan
    return var_win
```
In this version, we start by calculating the ratio of NaNs in the input array. If it is greater or equal to 0.5, we return the unmodified variance of the input array. Otherwise, we proceed with winsorization as in the original function.

2. Control flow version:
```
def _calculate_winsorized_variance_v2(a, g, axis):
    a_win = np.moveaxis(a, axis, -1)

    try:
        var_win = np.nanvar(a_win, axis=-1, ddof=1)
        a_win[..., :g] = a_win[..., [g]]
        a_win[..., -g:] = a_win[..., [-g - 1]]
        var_win = np.nanvar(a_win, axis=-1, ddof=1)
    except:
        var_win = _var(a, ddof=1, axis=axis)

    return var_win
```
In this version, we use exception handling to handle cases where `np.nanvar` fails due to excessive NaNs in the input array. If an exception is thrown, we return the unmodified variance as in the original function. Otherwise, we perform winsorization as in the original function.

## Response

Sure, here are the functions with the requested tags:

## Prompt

**For the python function with comments given in the variable 'code' below, write three inputs and outputs in a table and reason about the execution of the function. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: Assume variable's contents as required. The generated response must have the following qualities: concise, stepwise and specific.**

**code:**

```


def _calculate_winsorized_variance_v2(a, g, axis):
    a_win = np.moveaxis(a, axis, -1)

    try:
        var_win = np.nanvar(a_win, axis=-1, ddof=1)
        a_win[..., :g] = a_win[..., [g]]
        a_win[..., -g:] = a_win[..., [-g - 1]]
        var_win = np.nanvar(a_win, axis=-1, ddof=1)

    return var_win

## Response

Table of Inputs and Outputs:

| Input | Description | Output |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `a`=[ [ 1, 2, 3], [ 4, 5, 6] ]<br>`g`=2<br>`axis`=0 | The function is called with a 2D list `a` as input, where `g`=2, and `axis`=0. This means that the function will winsorize `a` along axis 0 and retain 2 values on each end. | [2.25, 2.25, 2.25] |
| `a`=[ [ 10, 20, 30], [ 10, 20, 30] ]<br>`g`=1<br>`axis`=1 | The function is called with a 2D list `a` as input, where `g`=1, and `axis`=1. This means that the function will winsorize `a` along axis 1 and retain 1 value on each end. | [ 62.5, 62.5 ] |
| `a`=[ [ 1, 2, 3], [ 4, 5, 6] ]<br>`g`=0<br>`axis`=2 | The function is called with a 2D list `a` as input, where `g`=0, and `axis`=2. This means that the function will not winsorize `a` along axis 2. | Error |

Function Execution:

1. The function `_calculate_winsorized_variance_v2` is called with input arguments `a`, `g`, and `axis`.
2. The function calls `np.moveaxis` to move the axis specified by `axis` to the end of the array.
3. The function then attempts to calculate the winsorized variance using `np.nanvar` along the last axis with `g` values truncated from each end. If successful, the winsorized variance is returned.
4. If an error occurs (e.g. `np.nanvar` is not available), `_var` is called instead to calculate the variance.
5. The final output is returned as the winsorized variance (or variance) of the input array along the selected axis.

## Prompt

**Show calculations and reasons about its execution for each of the above three input-output pairs.**

## Response

Input 1:
```
a=[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
g=2
axis=0
```
1. The input arguments are passed to the `_calculate_winsorized_variance_v2` function.
2. The function moves `axis` (which is 0) to the end of `a`. This results in a new array where `a` is represented as `[[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]`.
3. The function then attempts to calculate the winsorized variance along the last axis with 2 values truncated from each end.
   - The winsorized values of the last axis will be: `[3, 4, 5]`.
   - The variance calculated using these winsorized values is `(3-4.0)^2 + (4-4.0)^2 + (5-4.0)^2 / 2 =  2.25`.
   - This result is returned as the output.

Input 2:
```
a=[[10, 20, 30], [10, 20, 30]]
g=1
axis=1
```
1. The input arguments are passed to the `_calculate_winsorized_variance_v2` function.
2. The function moves `axis` (which is 1) to the end of `a`. This results in a new array where `a` is represented as `[[10,10],[20,20],[30,30]]`.
3. The function then attempts to calculate the winsorized variance along the last axis with 1 value truncated from each end.
   - The winsorized values of the last axis will be: `[10, 20]`.
   - The variance calculated using these winsorized values is `(10-15.0)^2 + (20-15.0)^2 / 1 = 62.5`.
   - This result is returned as the output.

Input 3:
```
a=[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
g=0
axis=2
```
1. The input arguments are passed to the `_calculate_winsorized_variance_v2` function.
2. The function moves `axis` (which is 2) to the end of `a`. This results in the same array as input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`.
3. The function then tries to calculate the winsorized variance along the last axis. But, as `g`=0, no truncation is performed. Therefore, the winsorized values are the same as the original values which means there is no variance. As `np.nanvar()` expects at least one value to be truncated at each end, it returns an error. This error is returned as the output.

```

## Response

Table:

| Input | Data Type | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| a | numpy array | Input array |
| g | integer | The number of elements to be winsorized |
| axis | integer | The axis along which the array is to be processed |

| Output | Data Type | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| var_win | float | The winsorized variance of the input array |
| or |
| var | float | The variance of the input array if g was 0 or if the input array contained more than 50% NaN values |

Execution:

1. The input array is processed by moving the axis mentioned in the axis argument to -1.
2. A boolean array of the same shape as the input array is created with True where there is at least one NaN element in the winosrized array.
3. The number of NaN elements is counted.
4. The ratio of NaN elements to total array elements is calculated.
5. If g is 0 or the NaN ratio is greater than or equal to 0.5, then the variance of the input array is calculated using the ddof=1 argument and is returned.
6. If g is greater than 0 and the NaN ratio is less than 0.5, then the first and last g values along the last axis of the winsorized array are replaced with the g-th and g-th to last values of the winsorized array, respectively.
7. The variance of the winsorized array is calculated along the last axis using the ddof=1 argument and NaN values are placed in positions marked True in the boolean array created in step 2.
8. The winsorized variance array is returned.
