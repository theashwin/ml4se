# For Mutant 1: 

## Prompt

**For the python function tell if it is buggy. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: The first word of your response must be `Yes` if the function is buggy, else `No`. Give a coherent explanation for your analysis. Also, if it is buggy then localize the bug in the function.**

**code:**

```

def economic_qs_linear(G):
    import dask.array as da

    if not isinstance(G, da.Array):
        G = asarray(G, float)

    if G.shape[0] >= G.shape[1]:
        (Q, Ssq, _) = svd(G, full_matrices=True)
        S0 = Ssq ** 2
        rank = len(S0)
        Q0, Q1 = Q[:, :rank], Q[:, rank:]
        return ((Q0, Q1), S0)

    return economic_qs(G.dot(G.T))

```

## Response

Yes, the function is buggy.

The function calls the method `economic_qs()` at the end of the method, however, this method is not defined in the code and it is not an import from another module.

        return ((Q0, Q1), S0)

    return economic_qs(G.dot(G.T))

```

## Response

No

Explanation:
This function looks correct. It takes in input a Dask array G and checks whether G is a Dask array. If not, it converts G into a float array. It then checks if the number of rows of G is less than the number of columns. If it is, it performs matrix decomposition and returns the results; otherwise, it performs another function economic_qs(). 

Without the knowledge of the functions `asarray()` and `economic_qs()`, we cannot fully verify that the code is completely correct.

## Prompt

**Now consider this information about the function provided to you in the previous message. The function is buggy, now your task is to find the exact location of the bug.**

## Response

Based on the information, we can see that there is no import statement for `svd()` and `asarray()` functions present in the function definition. As these functions are not defined in the current file, it will lead to `NameError` when the code tries to execute. Therefore, the bug is present in the following lines:

```python
(Q, Ssq, _) = svd(G, full_matrices=True)
G = asarray(G, float)
```

To fix this bug, we need to import the following libraries at the top of the file:

```python
from numpy.linalg import svd
from numpy import asarray
```

# For Mutant 3: 

## Prompt

**For the python function tell if it is buggy. Follow the instructions carefully. Instructions: The first word of your response must be `Yes` if the function is buggy, else `No`. Give a coherent explanation for your analysis. Also, if it is buggy then localize the bug in the function.**

**code:**

def economic_qs_linear(G):
    import dask.array as da

    if not isinstance(G, da.Array):
        G = asarray(G, float)

    if G.shape[0] <= G.shape[1]:
        (Q, Ssq, _) = svd(G, full_matrices=True)
        S0 = Ssq ** 2
        rank = len(S0)
        Q0, Q1 = Q[:, :rank], Q[:, rank:]
        return ((Q0, Q1), S0)

    return economic_qs(G.dot(G.T))

```

## Response

Yes, the function is buggy.

Issue 1: There is no import statement for the functions `asarray` and `svd`.
Issue 2: On the last line, the function is recursively called, but this call is missing an import statement for the function `economic_qs`.

        (Q, Ssq, _) = svd(G, full_matrices=True)
        S0 = Ssq ** 2
        rank = len(S0)
        Q0, Q1 = Q[:, :rank], Q[:, rank:]
        return ((Q0, Q1), S0)

    return economic_qs(G.dot(G.T))

```

## Response

Yes, the function is buggy.

At the end of the function, it calls itself recursively, but the parameter passed to the function is different from the original input. This means that the input is not breaking down continuously or is being reduced to smaller blocks as in a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Therefore, calling the same function again with different input while not reducing its original size will result in an infinite loop.

The bug can be fixed by passing an appropriate parameter to the `economic_qs` function that reduces the input array's size during each call.

        return ((Q0, Q1), S0)

    return economic_qs(G.dot(G.T))

```

## Response

Yes. The code is missing the import statements for svd and economic_qs functions. Therefore, these functions are not defined and can not be used in the function.
